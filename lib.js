/**
 * The Cisco Meraki Dashboard API is a modern REST API based on the [OpenAPI](https://swagger.io/docs/specification/about/) specification.

## What can the API be used for?
The Dashboard API can be used for many purposes. It's meant to be an open-ended tool. Here are some examples of use cases:

* Add new organizations, admins, networks, devices, VLANs, and more
* Configure networks at scale
* Automatically on-board and off-board new employees' teleworker setups
* Build your own dashboard for store managers, field techs, or unique use cases

## Enabling the Dashboard API
1. Begin by logging into [Meraki Dashboard](https://dashboard.meraki.com) and navigating to **Organization > Settings**

2. Locate the section titled **Dashboard API access** and select **Enable Access**, then **Save** your changes

3. After enabling the API, choose your username at the top-right of the Meraki Dashboard and select **my profile**

4. Locate the section titled **Dashboard API access** and select **Generate new API key**

*Note: The API key is associated with a Dashboard administrator account. You can generate, revoke, and regenerate your API key on your profile.*

**Keep your API key safe as it provides authentication to all of your organizations with the API enabled. If your API key is shared, you can regenerate your API key at any time. This will revoke the existing API key.**

Copy and store your API key in a safe place. Dashboard does not store API keys in plaintext for security reasons, so this is the only time you will be able to record it. If you lose or forget your API key, you will have to revoke it and generate a new one.

Every request must specify an API key via a request header.

The API key must be specified in the URL header. The API will return a 404 (rather than a 403) in response to a request with a missing or incorrect API key in order to prevent leaking the existence of resources to unauthorized users.

## Versioning
Once an API version is released, we will make only backwards-compatible changes to it. Backwards-compatible changes include:

* Adding new API resources

* Adding new optional request parameters to existing API methods

* Adding new properties to existing API responses

* Changing the order of properties in existing API responses

## Rate Limit
* The Dashboard API is limited to **5 calls per second**, per organization.
* A burst of 5 additional calls are allowed in the first second, so a maximum of 15 calls in the first 2 seconds.
* The rate limiting technique is based off of the [token bucket model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Token_bucket).
* An error with a `429` status code will be returned when the rate limit has been exceeded.
* Expect to backoff for 1 - 2 seconds if the limit has been exceeded. You may have to wait potentially longer if a large number of requests were made within this timeframe.


## Additional Details
Identifiers in the API are opaque strings. A `{networkId}`, for example, might be the string "126043", whereas an `{orderId}` might contain characters, such as "4S1234567". Client applications must not try to parse them as numbers. Even identifiers that look like numbers might be too long to encode without loss of precision in Javascript, where the only numeric type is IEEE 754 floating point.

Verbs in the API follow the usual REST conventions:

`GET` returns the value of a resource or a list of resources, depending on whether an identifier is specified. For example, a `GET` of `/organizations` returns a list of organizations, whereas a `GET` of `/organizations/{organizationId}` returns a particular organization.

`POST` adds a new resource, as in a `POST` to `/organizations/{organizationId}/admins`, or performs some other non-idempotent change.

`PUT` updates a resource. `PUTs` are idempotent; they update a resource, creating it first if it does not already exist. A `PUT` should specify all the fields of a resource; the API will revert omitted fields to their default value.

`DELETE` removes a resource.

Once an API version is released, we will make only backwards-compatible changes to it. Backwards-compatible changes include:

* Adding new API resources

* Adding new optional request parameters to existing API methods

* Adding new properties to existing API responses

* Changing the order of properties in existing API responses

## Rate Limit
* The Dashboard API is limited to **5 calls per second**, per organization.
* A burst of 5 additional calls are allowed in the first second, so a maximum of 15 calls in the first 2 seconds.
* The rate limiting technique is based off of the [token bucket model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Token_bucket).
* An error with a `429` status code will be returned when the rate limit has been exceeded.
* Expect to backoff for 1 - 2 seconds if the limit has been exceeded. You may have to wait potentially longer if a large number of requests were made within this timeframe.

/**
 * Returns all configured analytic zones for this camera
 * @method
 * @name MerakiDashboardApi#getDeviceCameraAnalyticsZones
 * @param {object} parameters - method options and parameters
     * @param {string} parameters.serial - The Cisco Meraki Dashboard API is a modern REST API based on the [OpenAPI](https://swagger.io/docs/specification/about/) specification.

## What can the API be used for?
The Dashboard API can be used for many purposes. It's meant to be an open-ended tool. Here are some examples of use cases:

* Add new organizations, admins, networks, devices, VLANs, and more
* Configure networks at scale
* Automatically on-board and off-board new employees' teleworker setups
* Build your own dashboard for store managers, field techs, or unique use cases

## Enabling the Dashboard API
1. Begin by logging into [Meraki Dashboard](https://dashboard.meraki.com) and navigating to **Organization > Settings**

2. Locate the section titled **Dashboard API access** and select **Enable Access**, then **Save** your changes

3. After enabling the API, choose your username at the top-right of the Meraki Dashboard and select **my profile**

4. Locate the section titled **Dashboard API access** and select **Generate new API key**

*Note: The API key is associated with a Dashboard administrator account. You can generate, revoke, and regenerate your API key on your profile.*

**Keep your API key safe as it provides authentication to all of your organizations with the API enabled. If your API key is shared, you can regenerate your API key at any time. This will revoke the existing API key.**

Copy and store your API key in a safe place. Dashboard does not store API keys in plaintext for security reasons, so this is the only time you will be able to record it. If you lose or forget your API key, you will have to revoke it and generate a new one.

Every request must specify an API key via a request header.

The API key must be specified in the URL header. The API will return a 404 (rather than a 403) in response to a request with a missing or incorrect API key in order to prevent leaking the existence of resources to unauthorized users.

## Versioning
Once an API version is released, we will make only backwards-compatible changes to it. Backwards-compatible changes include:

* Adding new API resources

* Adding new optional request parameters to existing API methods

* Adding new properties to existing API responses

* Changing the order of properties in existing API responses

## Rate Limit
* The Dashboard API is limited to **5 calls per second**, per organization.
* A burst of 5 additional calls are allowed in the first second, so a maximum of 15 calls in the first 2 seconds.
* The rate limiting technique is based off of the [token bucket model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Token_bucket).
* An error with a `429` status code will be returned when the rate limit has been exceeded.
* Expect to backoff for 1 - 2 seconds if the limit has been exceeded. You may have to wait potentially longer if a large number of requests were made within this timeframe.


## Additional Details
Identifiers in the API are opaque strings. A `{networkId}`, for example, might be the string "126043", whereas an `{orderId}` might contain characters, such as "4S1234567". Client applications must not try to parse them as numbers. Even identifiers that look like numbers might be too long to encode without loss of precision in Javascript, where the only numeric type is IEEE 754 floating point.

Verbs in the API follow the usual REST conventions:

`GET` returns the value of a resource or a list of resources, depending on whether an identifier is specified. For example, a `GET` of `/organizations` returns a list of organizations, whereas a `GET` of `/organizations/{organizationId}` returns a particular organization.

`POST` adds a new resource, as in a `POST` to `/organizations/{organizationId}/admins`, or performs some other non-idempotent change.

`PUT` updates a resource. `PUTs` are idempotent; they update a resource, creating it first if it does not already exist. A `PUT` should specify all the fields of a resource; the API will revert omitted fields to their default value.

`DELETE` removes a resource.

 * @name MerakiDashboardApi#getDeviceSwitchPort
 * @param {object} parameters - method options and parameters
     * @param {string} parameters.serial - The Cisco Meraki Dashboard API is a modern REST API based on the [OpenAPI](https://swagger.io/docs/specification/about/) specification.

## What can the API be used for?
The Dashboard API can be used for many purposes. It's meant to be an open-ended tool. Here are some examples of use cases:

* Add new organizations, admins, networks, devices, VLANs, and more
* Configure networks at scale
* Automatically on-board and off-board new employees' teleworker setups
* Build your own dashboard for store managers, field techs, or unique use cases

## Enabling the Dashboard API
1. Begin by logging into [Meraki Dashboard](https://dashboard.meraki.com) and navigating to **Organization > Settings**

2. Locate the section titled **Dashboard API access** and select **Enable Access**, then **Save** your changes

3. After enabling the API, choose your username at the top-right of the Meraki Dashboard and select **my profile**

4. Locate the section titled **Dashboard API access** and select **Generate new API key**

*Note: The API key is associated with a Dashboard administrator account. You can generate, revoke, and regenerate your API key on your profile.*

**Keep your API key safe as it provides authentication to all of your organizations with the API enabled. If your API key is shared, you can regenerate your API key at any time. This will revoke the existing API key.**

Copy and store your API key in a safe place. Dashboard does not store API keys in plaintext for security reasons, so this is the only time you will be able to record it. If you lose or forget your API key, you will have to revoke it and generate a new one.

Every request must specify an API key via a request header.

The API key must be specified in the URL header. The API will return a 404 (rather than a 403) in response to a request with a missing or incorrect API key in order to prevent leaking the existence of resources to unauthorized users.

## Versioning
Once an API version is released, we will make only backwards-compatible changes to it. Backwards-compatible changes include:

* Adding new API resources

* Adding new optional request parameters to existing API methods

* Adding new properties to existing API responses

* Changing the order of properties in existing API responses

## Rate Limit
* The Dashboard API is limited to **5 calls per second**, per organization.
* A burst of 5 additional calls are allowed in the first second, so a maximum of 15 calls in the first 2 seconds.
* The rate limiting technique is based off of the [token bucket model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Token_bucket).
* An error with a `429` status code will be returned when the rate limit has been exceeded.
* Expect to backoff for 1 - 2 seconds if the limit has been exceeded. You may have to wait potentially longer if a large number of requests were made within this timeframe.


## Additional Details
Identifiers in the API are opaque strings. A `{networkId}`, for example, might be the string "126043", whereas an `{orderId}` might contain characters, such as "4S1234567". Client applications must not try to parse them as numbers. Even identifiers that look like numbers might be too long to encode without loss of precision in Javascript, where the only numeric type is IEEE 754 floating point.

Verbs in the API follow the usual REST conventions:

`GET` returns the value of a resource or a list of resources, depending on whether an identifier is specified. For example, a `GET` of `/organizations` returns a list of organizations, whereas a `GET` of `/organizations/{organizationId}` returns a particular organization.

`POST` adds a new resource, as in a `POST` to `/organizations/{organizationId}/admins`, or performs some other non-idempotent change.

`PUT` updates a resource. `PUTs` are idempotent; they update a resource, creating it first if it does not already exist. A `PUT` should specify all the fields of a resource; the API will revert omitted fields to their default value.

`DELETE` removes a resource.

Once an API version is released, we will make only backwards-compatible changes to it. Backwards-compatible changes include:

* Adding new API resources

* Adding new optional request parameters to existing API methods

* Adding new properties to existing API responses

* Changing the order of properties in existing API responses

## Rate Limit
* The Dashboard API is limited to **5 calls per second**, per organization.
* A burst of 5 additional calls are allowed in the first second, so a maximum of 15 calls in the first 2 seconds.
* The rate limiting technique is based off of the [token bucket model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Token_bucket).
* An error with a `429` status code will be returned when the rate limit has been exceeded.
* Expect to backoff for 1 - 2 seconds if the limit has been exceeded. You may have to wait potentially longer if a large number of requests were made within this timeframe.


## Additional Details
Identifiers in the API are opaque strings. A `{networkId}`, for example, might be the string "126043", whereas an `{orderId}` might contain characters, such as "4S1234567". Client applications must not try to parse them as numbers. Even identifiers that look like numbers might be too long to encode without loss of precision in Javascript, where the only numeric type is IEEE 754 floating point.

Verbs in the API follow the usual REST conventions:

`GET` returns the value of a resource or a list of resources, depending on whether an identifier is specified. For example, a `GET` of `/organizations` returns a list of organizations, whereas a `GET` of `/organizations/{organizationId}` returns a particular organization.

`POST` adds a new resource, as in a `POST` to `/organizations/{organizationId}/admins`, or performs some other non-idempotent change.

`PUT` updates a resource. `PUTs` are idempotent; they update a resource, creating it first if it does not already exist. A `PUT` should specify all the fields of a resource; the API will revert omitted fields to their default value.

`DELETE` removes a resource.

## What can the API be used for?
The Dashboard API can be used for many purposes. It's meant to be an open-ended tool. Here are some examples of use cases:

* Add new organizations, admins, networks, devices, VLANs, and more
* Configure networks at scale
* Automatically on-board and off-board new employees' teleworker setups
* Build your own dashboard for store managers, field techs, or unique use cases

## Enabling the Dashboard API
1. Begin by logging into [Meraki Dashboard](https://dashboard.meraki.com) and navigating to **Organization > Settings**

2. Locate the section titled **Dashboard API access** and select **Enable Access**, then **Save** your changes

3. After enabling the API, choose your username at the top-right of the Meraki Dashboard and select **my profile**

4. Locate the section titled **Dashboard API access** and select **Generate new API key**

*Note: The API key is associated with a Dashboard administrator account. You can generate, revoke, and regenerate your API key on your profile.*

**Keep your API key safe as it provides authentication to all of your organizations with the API enabled. If your API key is shared, you can regenerate your API key at any time. This will revoke the existing API key.**

Copy and store your API key in a safe place. Dashboard does not store API keys in plaintext for security reasons, so this is the only time you will be able to record it. If you lose or forget your API key, you will have to revoke it and generate a new one.

Every request must specify an API key via a request header.

The API key must be specified in the URL header. The API will return a 404 (rather than a 403) in response to a request with a missing or incorrect API key in order to prevent leaking the existence of resources to unauthorized users.

1. Begin by logging into [Meraki Dashboard](https://dashboard.meraki.com) and navigating to **Organization > Settings**

2. Locate the section titled **Dashboard API access** and select **Enable Access**, then **Save** your changes

3. After enabling the API, choose your username at the top-right of the Meraki Dashboard and select **my profile**

4. Locate the section titled **Dashboard API access** and select **Generate new API key**

*Note: The API key is associated with a Dashboard administrator account. You can generate, revoke, and regenerate your API key on your profile.*

**Keep your API key safe as it provides authentication to all of your organizations with the API enabled. If your API key is shared, you can regenerate your API key at any time. This will revoke the existing API key.**

Copy and store your API key in a safe place. Dashboard does not store API keys in plaintext for security reasons, so this is the only time you will be able to record it. If you lose or forget your API key, you will have to revoke it and generate a new one.

Every request must specify an API key via a request header.

The API key must be specified in the URL header. The API will return a 404 (rather than a 403) in response to a request with a missing or incorrect API key in order to prevent leaking the existence of resources to unauthorized users.

## Versioning
Once an API version is released, we will make only backwards-compatible changes to it. Backwards-compatible changes include:

* Adding new API resources

* Adding new optional request parameters to existing API methods

* Adding new properties to existing API responses

* Changing the order of properties in existing API responses

## Rate Limit
* The Dashboard API is limited to **5 calls per second**, per organization.
* A burst of 5 additional calls are allowed in the first second, so a maximum of 15 calls in the first 2 seconds.
* The rate limiting technique is based off of the [token bucket model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Token_bucket).
* An error with a `429` status code will be returned when the rate limit has been exceeded.
* Expect to backoff for 1 - 2 seconds if the limit has been exceeded. You may have to wait potentially longer if a large number of requests were made within this timeframe.


## Additional Details
Identifiers in the API are opaque strings. A `{networkId}`, for example, might be the string "126043", whereas an `{orderId}` might contain characters, such as "4S1234567". Client applications must not try to parse them as numbers. Even identifiers that look like numbers might be too long to encode without loss of precision in Javascript, where the only numeric type is IEEE 754 floating point.

Verbs in the API follow the usual REST conventions:

`GET` returns the value of a resource or a list of resources, depending on whether an identifier is specified. For example, a `GET` of `/organizations` returns a list of organizations, whereas a `GET` of `/organizations/{organizationId}` returns a particular organization.

`POST` adds a new resource, as in a `POST` to `/organizations/{organizationId}/admins`, or performs some other non-idempotent change.

`PUT` updates a resource. `PUTs` are idempotent; they update a resource, creating it first if it does not already exist. A `PUT` should specify all the fields of a resource; the API will revert omitted fields to their default value.

`DELETE` removes a resource.

## What can the API be used for?
The Dashboard API can be used for many purposes. It's meant to be an open-ended tool. Here are some examples of use cases:

* Add new organizations, admins, networks, devices, VLANs, and more
* Configure networks at scale
* Automatically on-board and off-board new employees' teleworker setups
* Build your own dashboard for store managers, field techs, or unique use cases

Identifiers in the API are opaque strings. A `{networkId}`, for example, might be the string "126043", whereas an `{orderId}` might contain characters, such as "4S1234567". Client applications must not try to parse them as numbers. Even identifiers that look like numbers might be too long to encode without loss of precision in Javascript, where the only numeric type is IEEE 754 floating point.

Verbs in the API follow the usual REST conventions:

`GET` returns the value of a resource or a list of resources, depending on whether an identifier is specified. For example, a `GET` of `/organizations` returns a list of organizations, whereas a `GET` of `/organizations/{organizationId}` returns a particular organization.

`POST` adds a new resource, as in a `POST` to `/organizations/{organizationId}/admins`, or performs some other non-idempotent change.

`PUT` updates a resource. `PUTs` are idempotent; they update a resource, creating it first if it does not already exist. A `PUT` should specify all the fields of a resource; the API will revert omitted fields to their default value.

`DELETE` removes a resource.

## What can the API be used for?
The Dashboard API can be used for many purposes. It's meant to be an open-ended tool. Here are some examples of use cases:

* Add new organizations, admins, networks, devices, VLANs, and more
* Configure networks at scale
* Automatically on-board and off-board new employees' teleworker setups
* Build your own dashboard for store managers, field techs, or unique use cases

## Enabling the Dashboard API
1. Begin by logging into [Meraki Dashboard](https://dashboard.meraki.com) and navigating to **Organization > Settings**

2. Locate the section titled **Dashboard API access** and select **Enable Access**, then **Save** your changes

3. After enabling the API, choose your username at the top-right of the Meraki Dashboard and select **my profile**

4. Locate the section titled **Dashboard API access** and select **Generate new API key**

*Note: The API key is associated with a Dashboard administrator account. You can generate, revoke, and regenerate your API key on your profile.*

**Keep your API key safe as it provides authentication to all of your organizations with the API enabled. If your API key is shared, you can regenerate your API key at any time. This will revoke the existing API key.**

Copy and store your API key in a safe place. Dashboard does not store API keys in plaintext for security reasons, so this is the only time you will be able to record it. If you lose or forget your API key, you will have to revoke it and generate a new one.

Every request must specify an API key via a request header.

The API key must be specified in the URL header. The API will return a 404 (rather than a 403) in response to a request with a missing or incorrect API key in order to prevent leaking the existence of resources to unauthorized users.

## Versioning
Once an API version is released, we will make only backwards-compatible changes to it. Backwards-compatible changes include:

* Adding new API resources

* Adding new optional request parameters to existing API methods

* Adding new properties to existing API responses

* Changing the order of properties in existing API responses

## Rate Limit
* The Dashboard API is limited to **5 calls per second**, per organization.
* A burst of 5 additional calls are allowed in the first second, so a maximum of 15 calls in the first 2 seconds.
* The rate limiting technique is based off of the [token bucket model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Token_bucket).
* An error with a `429` status code will be returned when the rate limit has been exceeded.
* Expect to backoff for 1 - 2 seconds if the limit has been exceeded. You may have to wait potentially longer if a large number of requests were made within this timeframe.

Once an API version is released, we will make only backwards-compatible changes to it. Backwards-compatible changes include:

* Adding new API resources

* Adding new optional request parameters to existing API methods

* Adding new properties to existing API responses

* Changing the order of properties in existing API responses

## Rate Limit
* The Dashboard API is limited to **5 calls per second**, per organization.
* A burst of 5 additional calls are allowed in the first second, so a maximum of 15 calls in the first 2 seconds.
* The rate limiting technique is based off of the [token bucket model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Token_bucket).
* An error with a `429` status code will be returned when the rate limit has been exceeded.
* Expect to backoff for 1 - 2 seconds if the limit has been exceeded. You may have to wait potentially longer if a large number of requests were made within this timeframe.


## Additional Details
Identifiers in the API are opaque strings. A `{networkId}`, for example, might be the string "126043", whereas an `{orderId}` might contain characters, such as "4S1234567". Client applications must not try to parse them as numbers. Even identifiers that look like numbers might be too long to encode without loss of precision in Javascript, where the only numeric type is IEEE 754 floating point.

Verbs in the API follow the usual REST conventions:

`GET` returns the value of a resource or a list of resources, depending on whether an identifier is specified. For example, a `GET` of `/organizations` returns a list of organizations, whereas a `GET` of `/organizations/{organizationId}` returns a particular organization.

`POST` adds a new resource, as in a `POST` to `/organizations/{organizationId}/admins`, or performs some other non-idempotent change.

`PUT` updates a resource. `PUTs` are idempotent; they update a resource, creating it first if it does not already exist. A `PUT` should specify all the fields of a resource; the API will revert omitted fields to their default value.

`DELETE` removes a resource.

2. Locate the section titled **Dashboard API access** and select **Enable Access**, then **Save** your changes

3. After enabling the API, choose your username at the top-right of the Meraki Dashboard and select **my profile**

4. Locate the section titled **Dashboard API access** and select **Generate new API key**

*Note: The API key is associated with a Dashboard administrator account. You can generate, revoke, and regenerate your API key on your profile.*

**Keep your API key safe as it provides authentication to all of your organizations with the API enabled. If your API key is shared, you can regenerate your API key at any time. This will revoke the existing API key.**

Copy and store your API key in a safe place. Dashboard does not store API keys in plaintext for security reasons, so this is the only time you will be able to record it. If you lose or forget your API key, you will have to revoke it and generate a new one.

Every request must specify an API key via a request header.

The API key must be specified in the URL header. The API will return a 404 (rather than a 403) in response to a request with a missing or incorrect API key in order to prevent leaking the existence of resources to unauthorized users.

## Versioning
Once an API version is released, we will make only backwards-compatible changes to it. Backwards-compatible changes include:

* Adding new API resources

* Adding new optional request parameters to existing API methods

* Adding new properties to existing API responses

* Changing the order of properties in existing API responses

## Rate Limit
* The Dashboard API is limited to **5 calls per second**, per organization.
* A burst of 5 additional calls are allowed in the first second, so a maximum of 15 calls in the first 2 seconds.
* The rate limiting technique is based off of the [token bucket model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Token_bucket).
* An error with a `429` status code will be returned when the rate limit has been exceeded.
* Expect to backoff for 1 - 2 seconds if the limit has been exceeded. You may have to wait potentially longer if a large number of requests were made within this timeframe.


## Additional Details
Identifiers in the API are opaque strings. A `{networkId}`, for example, might be the string "126043", whereas an `{orderId}` might contain characters, such as "4S1234567". Client applications must not try to parse them as numbers. Even identifiers that look like numbers might be too long to encode without loss of precision in Javascript, where the only numeric type is IEEE 754 floating point.

Verbs in the API follow the usual REST conventions:

`GET` returns the value of a resource or a list of resources, depending on whether an identifier is specified. For example, a `GET` of `/organizations` returns a list of organizations, whereas a `GET` of `/organizations/{organizationId}` returns a particular organization.

`POST` adds a new resource, as in a `POST` to `/organizations/{organizationId}/admins`, or performs some other non-idempotent change.

`PUT` updates a resource. `PUTs` are idempotent; they update a resource, creating it first if it does not already exist. A `PUT` should specify all the fields of a resource; the API will revert omitted fields to their default value.

`DELETE` removes a resource.

     * @param {boolean} parameters.includeConnectivityHistory - Include the connectivity history for this client
     * @param {integer} parameters.connectivityHistoryTimespan - The timespan, in seconds, for the connectivityHistory data. By default 1 day, 86400, will be used.

The API key must be specified in the URL header. The API will return a 404 (rather than a 403) in response to a request with a missing or incorrect API key in order to prevent leaking the existence of resources to unauthorized users.

## Versioning
Once an API version is released, we will make only backwards-compatible changes to it. Backwards-compatible changes include:

* Adding new API resources

* Adding new optional request parameters to existing API methods

* Adding new properties to existing API responses

* Changing the order of properties in existing API responses

## Rate Limit
* The Dashboard API is limited to **5 calls per second**, per organization.
* A burst of 5 additional calls are allowed in the first second, so a maximum of 15 calls in the first 2 seconds.
* The rate limiting technique is based off of the [token bucket model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Token_bucket).
* An error with a `429` status code will be returned when the rate limit has been exceeded.
* Expect to backoff for 1 - 2 seconds if the limit has been exceeded. You may have to wait potentially longer if a large number of requests were made within this timeframe.


## Additional Details
Identifiers in the API are opaque strings. A `{networkId}`, for example, might be the string "126043", whereas an `{orderId}` might contain characters, such as "4S1234567". Client applications must not try to parse them as numbers. Even identifiers that look like numbers might be too long to encode without loss of precision in Javascript, where the only numeric type is IEEE 754 floating point.

Verbs in the API follow the usual REST conventions:

`GET` returns the value of a resource or a list of resources, depending on whether an identifier is specified. For example, a `GET` of `/organizations` returns a list of organizations, whereas a `GET` of `/organizations/{organizationId}` returns a particular organization.

`POST` adds a new resource, as in a `POST` to `/organizations/{organizationId}/admins`, or performs some other non-idempotent change.

`PUT` updates a resource. `PUTs` are idempotent; they update a resource, creating it first if it does not already exist. A `PUT` should specify all the fields of a resource; the API will revert omitted fields to their default value.

`DELETE` removes a resource.

## What can the API be used for?
The Dashboard API can be used for many purposes. It's meant to be an open-ended tool. Here are some examples of use cases:

* Add new organizations, admins, networks, devices, VLANs, and more
* Configure networks at scale
* Automatically on-board and off-board new employees' teleworker setups
* Build your own dashboard for store managers, field techs, or unique use cases

## Enabling the Dashboard API
1. Begin by logging into [Meraki Dashboard](https://dashboard.meraki.com) and navigating to **Organization > Settings**

2. Locate the section titled **Dashboard API access** and select **Enable Access**, then **Save** your changes

3. After enabling the API, choose your username at the top-right of the Meraki Dashboard and select **my profile**

4. Locate the section titled **Dashboard API access** and select **Generate new API key**

*Note: The API key is associated with a Dashboard administrator account. You can generate, revoke, and regenerate your API key on your profile.*

**Keep your API key safe as it provides authentication to all of your organizations with the API enabled. If your API key is shared, you can regenerate your API key at any time. This will revoke the existing API key.**

Copy and store your API key in a safe place. Dashboard does not store API keys in plaintext for security reasons, so this is the only time you will be able to record it. If you lose or forget your API key, you will have to revoke it and generate a new one.

2. Locate the section titled **Dashboard API access** and select **Enable Access**, then **Save** your changes

3. After enabling the API, choose your username at the top-right of the Meraki Dashboard and select **my profile**

4. Locate the section titled **Dashboard API access** and select **Generate new API key**

*Note: The API key is associated with a Dashboard administrator account. You can generate, revoke, and regenerate your API key on your profile.*

**Keep your API key safe as it provides authentication to all of your organizations with the API enabled. If your API key is shared, you can regenerate your API key at any time. This will revoke the existing API key.**

Copy and store your API key in a safe place. Dashboard does not store API keys in plaintext for security reasons, so this is the only time you will be able to record it. If you lose or forget your API key, you will have to revoke it and generate a new one.

Every request must specify an API key via a request header.

The API key must be specified in the URL header. The API will return a 404 (rather than a 403) in response to a request with a missing or incorrect API key in order to prevent leaking the existence of resources to unauthorized users.

## Versioning
Once an API version is released, we will make only backwards-compatible changes to it. Backwards-compatible changes include:

* Adding new API resources

* Adding new optional request parameters to existing API methods

* Adding new properties to existing API responses

* Changing the order of properties in existing API responses

## Rate Limit
* The Dashboard API is limited to **5 calls per second**, per organization.
* A burst of 5 additional calls are allowed in the first second, so a maximum of 15 calls in the first 2 seconds.
* The rate limiting technique is based off of the [token bucket model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Token_bucket).
* An error with a `429` status code will be returned when the rate limit has been exceeded.
* Expect to backoff for 1 - 2 seconds if the limit has been exceeded. You may have to wait potentially longer if a large number of requests were made within this timeframe.


## Additional Details
Identifiers in the API are opaque strings. A `{networkId}`, for example, might be the string "126043", whereas an `{orderId}` might contain characters, such as "4S1234567". Client applications must not try to parse them as numbers. Even identifiers that look like numbers might be too long to encode without loss of precision in Javascript, where the only numeric type is IEEE 754 floating point.

Verbs in the API follow the usual REST conventions:

`GET` returns the value of a resource or a list of resources, depending on whether an identifier is specified. For example, a `GET` of `/organizations` returns a list of organizations, whereas a `GET` of `/organizations/{organizationId}` returns a particular organization.

`POST` adds a new resource, as in a `POST` to `/organizations/{organizationId}/admins`, or performs some other non-idempotent change.

`PUT` updates a resource. `PUTs` are idempotent; they update a resource, creating it first if it does not already exist. A `PUT` should specify all the fields of a resource; the API will revert omitted fields to their default value.

`DELETE` removes a resource.

     * @param {string} parameters.t0 - The beginning of the timespan for the data. The maximum lookback period is 31 days from today.
     * @param {number} parameters.timespan - The timespan for which the information will be fetched. If specifying timespan, do not specify parameter t0. The value must be in seconds and be less than or equal to 31 days. The default is 1 day.
     * @param {integer} parameters.perPage - The number of entries per page returned. Acceptable range is 3 - 1000. Default is 10.
     * @param {string} parameters.startingAfter - A token used by the server to indicate the start of the page. Often this is a timestamp or an ID but it is not limited to those. This parameter should not be defined by client applications. The link for the first, last, prev, or next page in the HTTP Link header should define it.
     * @param {string} parameters.endingBefore - A token used by the server to indicate the end of the page. Often this is a timestamp or an ID but it is not limited to those. This parameter should not be defined by client applications. The link for the first, last, prev, or next page in the HTTP Link header should define it.

## What can the API be used for?
The Dashboard API can be used for many purposes. It's meant to be an open-ended tool. Here are some examples of use cases:

* Add new organizations, admins, networks, devices, VLANs, and more
* Configure networks at scale
* Automatically on-board and off-board new employees' teleworker setups
* Build your own dashboard for store managers, field techs, or unique use cases

Copy and store your API key in a safe place. Dashboard does not store API keys in plaintext for security reasons, so this is the only time you will be able to record it. If you lose or forget your API key, you will have to revoke it and generate a new one.

## Versioning
Once an API version is released, we will make only backwards-compatible changes to it. Backwards-compatible changes include:

* Adding new API resources

* Adding new optional request parameters to existing API methods

* Adding new properties to existing API responses

* Changing the order of properties in existing API responses

## Rate Limit
* The Dashboard API is limited to **5 calls per second**, per organization.
* A burst of 5 additional calls are allowed in the first second, so a maximum of 15 calls in the first 2 seconds.
* The rate limiting technique is based off of the [token bucket model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Token_bucket).
* An error with a `429` status code will be returned when the rate limit has been exceeded.
* Expect to backoff for 1 - 2 seconds if the limit has been exceeded. You may have to wait potentially longer if a large number of requests were made within this timeframe.


## Additional Details
Identifiers in the API are opaque strings. A `{networkId}`, for example, might be the string "126043", whereas an `{orderId}` might contain characters, such as "4S1234567". Client applications must not try to parse them as numbers. Even identifiers that look like numbers might be too long to encode without loss of precision in Javascript, where the only numeric type is IEEE 754 floating point.

Verbs in the API follow the usual REST conventions:

`GET` returns the value of a resource or a list of resources, depending on whether an identifier is specified. For example, a `GET` of `/organizations` returns a list of organizations, whereas a `GET` of `/organizations/{organizationId}` returns a particular organization.

`POST` adds a new resource, as in a `POST` to `/organizations/{organizationId}/admins`, or performs some other non-idempotent change.

`PUT` updates a resource. `PUTs` are idempotent; they update a resource, creating it first if it does not already exist. A `PUT` should specify all the fields of a resource; the API will revert omitted fields to their default value.

`DELETE` removes a resource.

The Dashboard API can be used for many purposes. It's meant to be an open-ended tool. Here are some examples of use cases:

* Add new organizations, admins, networks, devices, VLANs, and more

* Automatically on-board and off-board new employees' teleworker setups
* Build your own dashboard for store managers, field techs, or unique use cases

## What can the API be used for?
The Dashboard API can be used for many purposes. It's meant to be an open-ended tool. Here are some examples of use cases:

* Add new organizations, admins, networks, devices, VLANs, and more
* Configure networks at scale
* Automatically on-board and off-board new employees' teleworker setups
* Build your own dashboard for store managers, field techs, or unique use cases

## Enabling the Dashboard API
1. Begin by logging into [Meraki Dashboard](https://dashboard.meraki.com) and navigating to **Organization > Settings**

2. Locate the section titled **Dashboard API access** and select **Enable Access**, then **Save** your changes

3. After enabling the API, choose your username at the top-right of the Meraki Dashboard and select **my profile**

4. Locate the section titled **Dashboard API access** and select **Generate new API key**

*Note: The API key is associated with a Dashboard administrator account. You can generate, revoke, and regenerate your API key on your profile.*

**Keep your API key safe as it provides authentication to all of your organizations with the API enabled. If your API key is shared, you can regenerate your API key at any time. This will revoke the existing API key.**

Copy and store your API key in a safe place. Dashboard does not store API keys in plaintext for security reasons, so this is the only time you will be able to record it. If you lose or forget your API key, you will have to revoke it and generate a new one.

Every request must specify an API key via a request header.

The API key must be specified in the URL header. The API will return a 404 (rather than a 403) in response to a request with a missing or incorrect API key in order to prevent leaking the existence of resources to unauthorized users.

## Versioning
Once an API version is released, we will make only backwards-compatible changes to it. Backwards-compatible changes include:

* Adding new API resources

* Adding new optional request parameters to existing API methods

* Adding new properties to existing API responses

* Changing the order of properties in existing API responses

## Rate Limit
* The Dashboard API is limited to **5 calls per second**, per organization.
* A burst of 5 additional calls are allowed in the first second, so a maximum of 15 calls in the first 2 seconds.
* The rate limiting technique is based off of the [token bucket model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Token_bucket).
* An error with a `429` status code will be returned when the rate limit has been exceeded.
* Expect to backoff for 1 - 2 seconds if the limit has been exceeded. You may have to wait potentially longer if a large number of requests were made within this timeframe.


## Additional Details
Identifiers in the API are opaque strings. A `{networkId}`, for example, might be the string "126043", whereas an `{orderId}` might contain characters, such as "4S1234567".

     * @param {integer} parameters.perPage - The number of entries per page returned. Acceptable range is 3 - 100. Default is 100.
     * @param {string} parameters.startingAfter - A token used by the server to indicate the start of the page. Often this is a timestamp or an ID but it is not limited to those. This parameter should not be defined by client applications. The link for the first, last, prev, or next page in the HTTP Link header should define it.
     * @param {string} parameters.endingBefore - A token used by the server to indicate the end of the page. Often this is a timestamp or an ID but it is not limited to those.

/**
 * Return the policy assigned to a client on the network. Clients can be identified by a client key or either the MAC or IP depending on whether the network uses Track-by-IP.
 * @method
 * @name MerakiDashboardApi#getNetworkClientPolicy
 * @param {object} parameters - method options and parameters
     * @param {string} parameters.networkId - The Cisco Meraki Dashboard API is a modern REST API based on the [OpenAPI](https://swagger.io/docs/specification/about/) specification.

## What can the API be used for?
The Dashboard API can be used for many purposes. It's meant to be an open-ended tool. Here are some examples of use cases:

* Add new organizations, admins, networks, devices, VLANs, and more
* Configure networks at scale
* Automatically on-board and off-board new employees' teleworker setups
* Build your own dashboard for store managers, field techs, or unique use cases

## Enabling the Dashboard API
1. Begin by logging into [Meraki Dashboard](https://dashboard.meraki.com) and navigating to **Organization > Settings**

2. Locate the section titled **Dashboard API access** and select **Enable Access**, then **Save** your changes

3. After enabling the API, choose your username at the top-right of the Meraki Dashboard and select **my profile**

4. Locate the section titled **Dashboard API access** and select **Generate new API key**

*Note: The API key is associated with a Dashboard administrator account. You can generate, revoke, and regenerate your API key on your profile.*

**Keep your API key safe as it provides authentication to all of your organizations with the API enabled. If your API key is shared, you can regenerate your API key at any time. This will revoke the existing API key.**

Copy and store your API key in a safe place. Dashboard does not store API keys in plaintext for security reasons, so this is the only time you will be able to record it. If you lose or forget your API key, you will have to revoke it and generate a new one.

Every request must specify an API key via a request header.

The API key must be specified in the URL header. The API will return a 404 (rather than a 403) in response to a request with a missing or incorrect API key in order to prevent leaking the existence of resources to unauthorized users.

`X-Cisco-Meraki-API-Key: <secret key>`

Read more about API [authorization](../api/#/python/getting-started/authorizing-your-client)


## Versioning
Once an API version is released, we will make only backwards-compatible changes to it. Backwards-compatible changes include:

* Adding new API resources

* Adding new optional request parameters to existing API methods

* Adding new properties to existing API responses

* Changing the order of properties in existing API responses

## Rate Limit
* The Dashboard API is limited to **5 calls per second**, per organization.
* A burst of 5 additional calls are allowed in the first second, so a maximum of 15 calls in the first 2 seconds.
* The rate limiting technique is based off of the [token bucket model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Token_bucket).
* An error with a `429` status code will be returned when the rate limit has been exceeded.
* Expect to backoff for 1 - 2 seconds if the limit has been exceeded. You may have to wait potentially longer if a large number of requests were made within this timeframe.


## Additional Details
Identifiers in the API are opaque strings. A `{networkId}`, for example, might be the string "126043", whereas an `{orderId}` might contain characters, such as "4S1234567". Client applications must not try to parse them as numbers. Even identifiers that look like numbers might be too long to encode without loss of precision in Javascript, where the only numeric type is IEEE 754 floating point.

Verbs in the API follow the usual REST conventions:

`GET` returns the value of a resource or a list of resources, depending on whether an identifier is specified. For example, a `GET` of `/organizations` returns a list of organizations, whereas a `GET` of `/organizations/{organizationId}` returns a particular organization.

`POST` adds a new resource, as in a `POST` to `/organizations/{organizationId}/admins`, or performs some other non-idempotent change.

`PUT` updates a resource. `PUTs` are idempotent; they update a resource, creating it first if it does not already exist. A `PUT` should specify all the fields of a resource; the API will revert omitted fields to their default value.

`DELETE` removes a resource.

`GET` returns the value of a resource or a list of resources, depending on whether an identifier is specified. For example, a `GET` of `/organizations` returns a list of organizations, whereas a `GET` of `/organizations/{organizationId}` returns a particular organization.

`POST` adds a new resource, as in a `POST` to `/organizations/{organizationId}/admins`, or performs some other non-idempotent change.

`PUT` updates a resource. `PUTs` are idempotent; they update a resource, creating it first if it does not already exist. A `PUT` should specify all the fields of a resource; the API will revert omitted fields to their default value.

`DELETE` removes a resource.

     * @param {string} parameters.clientId - The Cisco Meraki Dashboard API is a modern REST API based on the [OpenAPI](https://swagger.io/docs/specification/about/) specification.

## What can the API be used for?
The Dashboard API can be used for many purposes. It's meant to be an open-ended tool. Here are some examples of use cases:

* Add new organizations, admins, networks, devices, VLANs, and more
* Configure networks at scale
* Automatically on-board and off-board new employees' teleworker setups
* Build your own dashboard for store managers, field techs, or unique use cases

## Enabling the Dashboard API
1. Begin by logging into [Meraki Dashboard](https://dashboard.meraki.com) and navigating to **Organization > Settings**

2. Locate the section titled **Dashboard API access** and select **Enable Access**, then **Save** your changes

3. After enabling the API, choose your username at the top-right of the Meraki Dashboard and select **my profile**

4. Locate the section titled **Dashboard API access** and select **Generate new API key**

*Note: The API key is associated with a Dashboard administrator account. You can generate, revoke, and regenerate your API key on your profile.*

**Keep your API key safe as it provides authentication to all of your organizations with the API enabled. If your API key is shared, you can regenerate your API key at any time. This will revoke the existing API key.**

Copy and store your API key in a safe place. Dashboard does not store API keys in plaintext for security reasons, so this is the only time you will be able to record it. If you lose or forget your API key, you will have to revoke it and generate a new one.

Every request must specify an API key via a request header.

The API key must be specified in the URL header. The API will return a 404 (rather than a 403) in response to a request with a missing or incorrect API key in order to prevent leaking the existence of resources to unauthorized users.

## Versioning
Once an API version is released, we will make only backwards-compatible changes to it. Backwards-compatible changes include:

* Adding new API resources

* Adding new optional request parameters to existing API methods

* Adding new properties to existing API responses

* Changing the order of properties in existing API responses

## Rate Limit
* The Dashboard API is limited to **5 calls per second**, per organization.
* A burst of 5 additional calls are allowed in the first second, so a maximum of 15 calls in the first 2 seconds.
* The rate limiting technique is based off of the [token bucket model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Token_bucket).
* An error with a `429` status code will be returned when the rate limit has been exceeded.
* Expect to backoff for 1 - 2 seconds if the limit has been exceeded. You may have to wait potentially longer if a large number of requests were made within this timeframe.


## Additional Details
Identifiers in the API are opaque strings. A `{networkId}`, for example, might be the string "126043", whereas an `{orderId}` might contain characters, such as "4S1234567". Client applications must not try to parse them as numbers. Even identifiers that look like numbers might be too long to encode without loss of precision in Javascript, where the only numeric type is IEEE 754 floating point.

Verbs in the API follow the usual REST conventions:

`GET` returns the value of a resource or a list of resources, depending on whether an identifier is specified. For example, a `GET` of `/organizations` returns a list of organizations, whereas a `GET` of `/organizations/{organizationId}` returns a particular organization.

`POST` adds a new resource, as in a `POST` to `/organizations/{organizationId}/admins`, or performs some other non-idempotent change.

`PUT` updates a resource. `PUTs` are idempotent; they update a resource, creating it first if it does not already exist. A `PUT` should specify all the fields of a resource; the API will revert omitted fields to their default value.

`DELETE` removes a resource.

     * @param {string} parameters.t0 - The beginning of the timespan for the data. The maximum lookback period is 791 days from today.
     * @param {string} parameters.t1 - The end of the timespan for the data. t1 can be a maximum of 791 days after t0.
     * @param {number} parameters.timespan - The timespan for which the information will be fetched. If specifying timespan, do not specify parameters t0 and t1. The value must be in seconds and be less than or equal to 791 days. The default is 31 days.
     * @param {integer} parameters.perPage - The number of entries per page returned. Acceptable range is 3 - 1000. Default is 100.
     * @param {string} parameters.startingAfter - A token used by the server to indicate the start of the page. Often this is a timestamp or an ID but it is not limited to those. This parameter should not be defined by client applications. The link for the first, last, prev, or next page in the HTTP Link header should define it.
     * @param {string} parameters.endingBefore - A token used by the server to indicate the end of the page. Often this is a timestamp or an ID but it is not limited to those. This parameter should not be defined by client applications. The link for the first, last, prev, or next page in the HTTP Link header should define it.

Identifiers in the API are opaque strings. A `{networkId}`, for example, might be the string "126043", whereas an `{orderId}` might contain characters, such as "4S1234567". Client applications must not try to parse them as numbers. Even identifiers that look like numbers might be too long to encode without loss of precision in Javascript, where the only numeric type is IEEE 754 floating point.

Verbs in the API follow the usual REST conventions:

`GET` returns the value of a resource or a list of resources, depending on whether an identifier is specified. For example, a `GET` of `/organizations` returns a list of organizations, whereas a `GET` of `/organizations/{organizationId}` returns a particular organization.

`POST` adds a new resource, as in a `POST` to `/organizations/{organizationId}/admins`, or performs some other non-idempotent change.

`PUT` updates a resource. `PUTs` are idempotent; they update a resource, creating it first if it does not already exist. A `PUT` should specify all the fields of a resource; the API will revert omitted fields to their default value.

`DELETE` removes a resource.

/**
 * Return the client's network traffic data over time. Usage data is in kilobytes. This endpoint requires detailed traffic analysis to be enabled on the Network-wide > General page. Clients can be identified by a client key or either the MAC or IP depending on whether the network uses Track-by-IP.
 * @method
 * @name MerakiDashboardApi#getNetworkClientTrafficHistory
 * @param {object} parameters - method options and parameters
     * @param {string} parameters.networkId - The Cisco Meraki Dashboard API is a modern REST API based on the [OpenAPI](https://swagger.io/docs/specification/about/) specification.

## What can the API be used for?
The Dashboard API can be used for many purposes. It's meant to be an open-ended tool. Here are some examples of use cases:

* Add new organizations, admins, networks, devices, VLANs, and more
* Configure networks at scale
* Automatically on-board and off-board new employees' teleworker setups
* Build your own dashboard for store managers, field techs, or unique use cases

## Enabling the Dashboard API
1. Begin by logging into [Meraki Dashboard](https://dashboard.meraki.com) and navigating to **Organization > Settings**

2. Locate the section titled **Dashboard API access** and select **Enable Access**, then **Save** your changes

3. After enabling the API, choose your username at the top-right of the Meraki Dashboard and select **my profile**

4. Locate the section titled **Dashboard API access** and select **Generate new API key**

*Note: The API key is associated with a Dashboard administrator account. You can generate, revoke, and regenerate your API key on your profile.*

**Keep your API key safe as it provides authentication to all of your organizations with the API enabled. If your API key is shared, you can regenerate your API key at any time. This will revoke the existing API key.**

Copy and store your API key in a safe place. Dashboard does not store API keys in plaintext for security reasons, so this is the only time you will be able to record it. If you lose or forget your API key, you will have to revoke it and generate a new one.

Every request must specify an API key via a request header.

The API key must be specified in the URL header. The API will return a 404 (rather than a 403) in response to a request with a missing or incorrect API key in order to prevent leaking the existence of resources to unauthorized users.

## Versioning
Once an API version is released, we will make only backwards-compatible changes to it. Backwards-compatible changes include:

* Adding new API resources

* Adding new optional request parameters to existing API methods

* Adding new properties to existing API responses

* Changing the order of properties in existing API responses

## Rate Limit
* The Dashboard API is limited to **5 calls per second**, per organization.
* A burst of 5 additional calls are allowed in the first second, so a maximum of 15 calls in the first 2 seconds.
* The rate limiting technique is based off of the [token bucket model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Token_bucket).
* An error with a `429` status code will be returned when the rate limit has been exceeded.
* Expect to backoff for 1 - 2 seconds if the limit has been exceeded. You may have to wait potentially longer if a large number of requests were made within this timeframe.

/**
 * Return the connectivity testing destinations for an MX network
 * @method
 * @name MerakiDashboardApi#getNetworkConnectivityMonitoringDestinations
 * @param {object} parameters - method options and parameters
     * @param {string} parameters.networkId - The Cisco Meraki Dashboard API is a modern REST API based on the [OpenAPI](https://swagger.io/docs/specification/about/) specification.

## What can the API be used for?
The Dashboard API can be used for many purposes. It's meant to be an open-ended tool. Here are some examples of use cases:

* Add new organizations, admins, networks, devices, VLANs, and more
* Configure networks at scale
* Automatically on-board and off-board new employees' teleworker setups
* Build your own dashboard for store managers, field techs, or unique use cases

## Enabling the Dashboard API
1. Begin by logging into [Meraki Dashboard](https://dashboard.meraki.com) and navigating to **Organization > Settings**

2. Locate the section titled **Dashboard API access** and select **Enable Access**, then **Save** your changes

3. After enabling the API, choose your username at the top-right of the Meraki Dashboard and select **my profile**

4. Locate the section titled **Dashboard API access** and select **Generate new API key**

*Note: The API key is associated with a Dashboard administrator account. You can generate, revoke, and regenerate your API key on your profile.*

**Keep your API key safe as it provides authentication to all of your organizations with the API enabled. If your API key is shared, you can regenerate your API key at any time. This will revoke the existing API key.**

Copy and store your API key in a safe place. Dashboard does not store API keys in plaintext for security reasons, so this is the only time you will be able to record it. If you lose or forget your API key, you will have to revoke it and generate a new one.

Every request must specify an API key via a request header.

The API key must be specified in the URL header. The API will return a 404 (rather than a 403) in response to a request with a missing or incorrect API key in order to prevent leaking the existence of resources to unauthorized users.

## Versioning
Once an API version is released, we will make only backwards-compatible changes to it. Backwards-compatible changes include:

* Adding new API resources

* Adding new optional request parameters to existing API methods

* Adding new properties to existing API responses

* Changing the order of properties in existing API responses

## Rate Limit
* The Dashboard API is limited to **5 calls per second**, per organization.
* A burst of 5 additional calls are allowed in the first second, so a maximum of 15 calls in the first 2 seconds.
* The rate limiting technique is based off of the [token bucket model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Token_bucket).
* An error with a `429` status code will be returned when the rate limit has been exceeded.
* Expect to backoff for 1 - 2 seconds if the limit has been exceeded. You may have to wait potentially longer if a large number of requests were made within this timeframe.


## Additional Details
Identifiers in the API are opaque strings. A `{networkId}`, for example, might be the string "126043", whereas an `{orderId}` might contain characters, such as "4S1234567". Client applications must not try to parse them as numbers. Even identifiers that look like numbers might be too long to encode without loss of precision in Javascript, where the only numeric type is IEEE 754 floating point.

Verbs in the API follow the usual REST conventions:

`GET` returns the value of a resource or a list of resources, depending on whether an identifier is specified. For example, a `GET` of `/organizations` returns a list of organizations, whereas a `GET` of `/organizations/{organizationId}` returns a particular organization.

`POST` adds a new resource, as in a `POST` to `/organizations/{organizationId}/admins`, or performs some other non-idempotent change.

`PUT` updates a resource. `PUTs` are idempotent; they update a resource, creating it first if it does not already exist. A `PUT` should specify all the fields of a resource; the API will revert omitted fields to their default value.

`DELETE` removes a resource.

`PUT` updates a resource. `PUTs` are idempotent; they update a resource, creating it first if it does not already exist. A `PUT` should specify all the fields of a resource; the API will revert omitted fields to their default value.

 * List all available content filtering categories for an MX network
 * @method
 * @name MerakiDashboardApi#getNetworkContentFilteringCategories
 * @param {object} parameters - method options and parameters
     * @param {string} parameters.networkId - The Cisco Meraki Dashboard API is a modern REST API based on the [OpenAPI](https://swagger.io/docs/specification/about/) specification.

## What can the API be used for?
The Dashboard API can be used for many purposes. It's meant to be an open-ended tool. Here are some examples of use cases:

* Add new organizations, admins, networks, devices, VLANs, and more
* Configure networks at scale
* Automatically on-board and off-board new employees' teleworker setups
* Build your own dashboard for store managers, field techs, or unique use cases

## Enabling the Dashboard API
1. Begin by logging into [Meraki Dashboard](https://dashboard.meraki.com) and navigating to **Organization > Settings**

2. Locate the section titled **Dashboard API access** and select **Enable Access**, then **Save** your changes

3. After enabling the API, choose your username at the top-right of the Meraki Dashboard and select **my profile**

4. Locate the section titled **Dashboard API access** and select **Generate new API key**

*Note: The API key is associated with a Dashboard administrator account. You can generate, revoke, and regenerate your API key on your profile.*

**Keep your API key safe as it provides authentication to all of your organizations with the API enabled. If your API key is shared, you can regenerate your API key at any time. This will revoke the existing API key.**

Copy and store your API key in a safe place. Dashboard does not store API keys in plaintext for security reasons, so this is the only time you will be able to record it. If you lose or forget your API key, you will have to revoke it and generate a new one.

Every request must specify an API key via a request header.

The API key must be specified in the URL header. The API will return a 404 (rather than a 403) in response to a request with a missing or incorrect API key in order to prevent leaking the existence of resources to unauthorized users.

## Versioning
Once an API version is released, we will make only backwards-compatible changes to it. Backwards-compatible changes include:

* Adding new API resources

* Adding new optional request parameters to existing API methods

* Adding new properties to existing API responses

* Changing the order of properties in existing API responses

## Rate Limit
* The Dashboard API is limited to **5 calls per second**, per organization.
* A burst of 5 additional calls are allowed in the first second, so a maximum of 15 calls in the first 2 seconds.
* The rate limiting technique is based off of the [token bucket model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Token_bucket).
* An error with a `429` status code will be returned when the rate limit has been exceeded.
* Expect to backoff for 1 - 2 seconds if the limit has been exceeded. You may have to wait potentially longer if a large number of requests were made within this timeframe.


## Additional Details
Identifiers in the API are opaque strings. A `{networkId}`, for example, might be the string "126043", whereas an `{orderId}` might contain characters, such as "4S1234567". Client applications must not try to parse them as numbers. Even identifiers that look like numbers might be too long to encode without loss of precision in Javascript, where the only numeric type is IEEE 754 floating point.

Verbs in the API follow the usual REST conventions:

`GET` returns the value of a resource or a list of resources, depending on whether an identifier is specified. For example, a `GET` of `/organizations` returns a list of organizations, whereas a `GET` of `/organizations/{organizationId}` returns a particular organization.

`POST` adds a new resource, as in a `POST` to `/organizations/{organizationId}/admins`, or performs some other non-idempotent change.

`PUT` updates a resource. `PUTs` are idempotent; they update a resource, creating it first if it does not already exist. A `PUT` should specify all the fields of a resource; the API will revert omitted fields to their default value.

`DELETE` removes a resource.

/**
 * Aggregated latency info for this network, grouped by node
 * @method
 * @name MerakiDashboardApi#getNetworkDevicesLatencyStats
 * @param {object} parameters - method options and parameters
     * @param {string} parameters.networkId - The Cisco Meraki Dashboard API is a modern REST API based on the [OpenAPI](https://swagger.io/docs/specification/about/) specification.

## What can the API be used for?
The Dashboard API can be used for many purposes. It's meant to be an open-ended tool. Here are some examples of use cases:

* Add new organizations, admins, networks, devices, VLANs, and more
* Configure networks at scale
* Automatically on-board and off-board new employees' teleworker setups
* Build your own dashboard for store managers, field techs, or unique use cases

## Enabling the Dashboard API
1. Begin by logging into [Meraki Dashboard](https://dashboard.meraki.com) and navigating to **Organization > Settings**

2. Locate the section titled **Dashboard API access** and select **Enable Access**, then **Save** your changes

3. After enabling the API, choose your username at the top-right of the Meraki Dashboard and select **my profile**

4. Locate the section titled **Dashboard API access** and select **Generate new API key**

*Note: The API key is associated with a Dashboard administrator account. You can generate, revoke, and regenerate your API key on your profile.*

**Keep your API key safe as it provides authentication to all of your organizations with the API enabled. If your API key is shared, you can regenerate your API key at any time. This will revoke the existing API key.**

Copy and store your API key in a safe place. Dashboard does not store API keys in plaintext for security reasons, so this is the only time you will be able to record it. If you lose or forget your API key, you will have to revoke it and generate a new one.

Every request must specify an API key via a request header.

The API key must be specified in the URL header. The API will return a 404 (rather than a 403) in response to a request with a missing or incorrect API key in order to prevent leaking the existence of resources to unauthorized users.

## Versioning
Once an API version is released, we will make only backwards-compatible changes to it. Backwards-compatible changes include:

* Adding new API resources

* Adding new optional request parameters to existing API methods

* Adding new properties to existing API responses

* Changing the order of properties in existing API responses

## Rate Limit
* The Dashboard API is limited to **5 calls per second**, per organization.
* A burst of 5 additional calls are allowed in the first second, so a maximum of 15 calls in the first 2 seconds.
* The rate limiting technique is based off of the [token bucket model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Token_bucket).
* An error with a `429` status code will be returned when the rate limit has been exceeded.
* Expect to backoff for 1 - 2 seconds if the limit has been exceeded. You may have to wait potentially longer if a large number of requests were made within this timeframe.


## Additional Details
Identifiers in the API are opaque strings. A `{networkId}`, for example, might be the string "126043", whereas an `{orderId}` might contain characters, such as "4S1234567". Client applications must not try to parse them as numbers. Even identifiers that look like numbers might be too long to encode without loss of precision in Javascript, where the only numeric type is IEEE 754 floating point.

Verbs in the API follow the usual REST conventions:

`GET` returns the value of a resource or a list of resources, depending on whether an identifier is specified. For example, a `GET` of `/organizations` returns a list of organizations, whereas a `GET` of `/organizations/{organizationId}` returns a particular organization.

`POST` adds a new resource, as in a `POST` to `/organizations/{organizationId}/admins`, or performs some other non-idempotent change.

`PUT` updates a resource. `PUTs` are idempotent; they update a resource, creating it first if it does not already exist. A `PUT` should specify all the fields of a resource; the API will revert omitted fields to their default value.

`DELETE` removes a resource.

     * @param {string} parameters.t0 - The beginning of the timespan for the data. The maximum lookback period is 180 days from today.
     * @param {string} parameters.t1 - The end of the timespan for the data. t1 can be a maximum of 7 days after t0.
     * @param {number} parameters.timespan - The timespan for which the information will be fetched. If specifying timespan, do not specify parameters t0 and t1. The value must be in seconds and be less than or equal to 7 days.
     * @param {integer} parameters.ssid - Filter results by SSID
     * @param {integer} parameters.vlan - Filter results by VLAN
     * @param {string} parameters.apTag - Filter results by AP Tag
     * @param {string} parameters.fields - Partial selection: If present, this call will return only the selected fields of ["rawDistribution", "avg"]. All fields will be returned by default. Selected fields must be entered as a comma separated string.

`GET` returns the value of a resource or a list of resources, depending on whether an identifier is specified. For example, a `GET` of `/organizations` returns a list of organizations, whereas a `GET` of `/organizations/{organizationId}` returns a particular organization.

`POST` adds a new resource, as in a `POST` to `/organizations/{organizationId}/admins`, or performs some other non-idempotent change.

`PUT` updates a resource. `PUTs` are idempotent; they update a resource, creating it first if it does not already exist. A `PUT` should specify all the fields of a resource; the API will revert omitted fields to their default value.

`DELETE` removes a resource.

/**
 * Blink the LEDs on a device
 * @method
 * @name MerakiDashboardApi#blinkNetworkDeviceLeds
 * @param {object} parameters - method options and parameters
     * @param {string} parameters.networkId - The Cisco Meraki Dashboard API is a modern REST API based on the [OpenAPI](https://swagger.io/docs/specification/about/) specification.

## What can the API be used for?
The Dashboard API can be used for many purposes. It's meant to be an open-ended tool. Here are some examples of use cases:

* Add new organizations, admins, networks, devices, VLANs, and more
* Configure networks at scale
* Automatically on-board and off-board new employees' teleworker setups
* Build your own dashboard for store managers, field techs, or unique use cases

## Enabling the Dashboard API
1. Begin by logging into [Meraki Dashboard](https://dashboard.meraki.com) and navigating to **Organization > Settings**

2. Locate the section titled **Dashboard API access** and select **Enable Access**, then **Save** your changes

3. After enabling the API, choose your username at the top-right of the Meraki Dashboard and select **my profile**

4. Locate the section titled **Dashboard API access** and select **Generate new API key**

*Note: The API key is associated with a Dashboard administrator account. You can generate, revoke, and regenerate your API key on your profile.*

**Keep your API key safe as it provides authentication to all of your organizations with the API enabled. If your API key is shared, you can regenerate your API key at any time. This will revoke the existing API key.**

Copy and store your API key in a safe place. Dashboard does not store API keys in plaintext for security reasons, so this is the only time you will be able to record it. If you lose or forget your API key, you will have to revoke it and generate a new one.

Every request must specify an API key via a request header.

The API key must be specified in the URL header. The API will return a 404 (rather than a 403) in response to a request with a missing or incorrect API key in order to prevent leaking the existence of resources to unauthorized users.

## Versioning
Once an API version is released, we will make only backwards-compatible changes to it. Backwards-compatible changes include:

* Adding new API resources

* Adding new optional request parameters to existing API methods

* Adding new properties to existing API responses

* Changing the order of properties in existing API responses

## Rate Limit
* The Dashboard API is limited to **5 calls per second**, per organization.
* A burst of 5 additional calls are allowed in the first second, so a maximum of 15 calls in the first 2 seconds.
* The rate limiting technique is based off of the [token bucket model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Token_bucket).
* An error with a `429` status code will be returned when the rate limit has been exceeded.
* Expect to backoff for 1 - 2 seconds if the limit has been exceeded. You may have to wait potentially longer if a large number of requests were made within this timeframe.


## Additional Details
Identifiers in the API are opaque strings. A `{networkId}`, for example, might be the string "126043", whereas an `{orderId}` might contain characters, such as "4S1234567". Client applications must not try to parse them as numbers. Even identifiers that look like numbers might be too long to encode without loss of precision in Javascript, where the only numeric type is IEEE 754 floating point.

Verbs in the API follow the usual REST conventions:

`GET` returns the value of a resource or a list of resources, depending on whether an identifier is specified. For example, a `GET` of `/organizations` returns a list of organizations, whereas a `GET` of `/organizations/{organizationId}` returns a particular organization.

`POST` adds a new resource, as in a `POST` to `/organizations/{organizationId}/admins`, or performs some other non-idempotent change.

`PUT` updates a resource. `PUTs` are idempotent; they update a resource, creating it first if it does not already exist. A `PUT` should specify all the fields of a resource; the API will revert omitted fields to their default value.

`DELETE` removes a resource.

*Note: The API key is associated with a Dashboard administrator account. You can generate, revoke, and regenerate your API key on your profile.*

**Keep your API key safe as it provides authentication to all of your organizations with the API enabled. If your API key is shared, you can regenerate your API key at any time. This will revoke the existing API key.**

Copy and store your API key in a safe place. Dashboard does not store API keys in plaintext for security reasons, so this is the only time you will be able to record it. If you lose or forget your API key, you will have to revoke it and generate a new one.

Every request must specify an API key via a request header.

The API key must be specified in the URL header. The API will return a 404 (rather than a 403) in response to a request with a missing or incorrect API key in order to prevent leaking the existence of resources to unauthorized users.

## Versioning
Once an API version is released, we will make only backwards-compatible changes to it. Backwards-compatible changes include:

* Adding new API resources

* Adding new optional request parameters to existing API methods

* Adding new properties to existing API responses

* Changing the order of properties in existing API responses

## Rate Limit
* The Dashboard API is limited to **5 calls per second**, per organization.
* A burst of 5 additional calls are allowed in the first second, so a maximum of 15 calls in the first 2 seconds.
* The rate limiting technique is based off of the [token bucket model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Token_bucket).
* An error with a `429` status code will be returned when the rate limit has been exceeded.
* Expect to backoff for 1 - 2 seconds if the limit has been exceeded. You may have to wait potentially longer if a large number of requests were made within this timeframe.


## Additional Details
Identifiers in the API are opaque strings. A `{networkId}`, for example, might be the string "126043", whereas an `{orderId}` might contain characters, such as "4S1234567". Client applications must not try to parse them as numbers. Even identifiers that look like numbers might be too long to encode without loss of precision in Javascript, where the only numeric type is IEEE 754 floating point.

Verbs in the API follow the usual REST conventions:

`GET` returns the value of a resource or a list of resources, depending on whether an identifier is specified. For example, a `GET` of `/organizations` returns a list of organizations, whereas a `GET` of `/organizations/{organizationId}` returns a particular organization.

`POST` adds a new resource, as in a `POST` to `/organizations/{organizationId}/admins`, or performs some other non-idempotent change.

`PUT` updates a resource. `PUTs` are idempotent; they update a resource, creating it first if it does not already exist. A `PUT` should specify all the fields of a resource; the API will revert omitted fields to their default value.

`DELETE` removes a resource.

     * @param {string} parameters.serial - The Cisco Meraki Dashboard API is a modern REST API based on the [OpenAPI](https://swagger.io/docs/specification/about/) specification.

## What can the API be used for?
The Dashboard API can be used for many purposes. It's meant to be an open-ended tool. Here are some examples of use cases:

* Add new organizations, admins, networks, devices, VLANs, and more
* Configure networks at scale
* Automatically on-board and off-board new employees' teleworker setups
* Build your own dashboard for store managers, field techs, or unique use cases

`PUT` updates a resource. `PUTs` are idempotent; they update a resource, creating it first if it does not already exist. A `PUT` should specify all the fields of a resource; the API will revert omitted fields to their default value.

`DELETE` removes a resource.

     * @param {string} parameters.t0 - The beginning of the timespan for the data. The maximum lookback period is 365 days from today.
     * @param {string} parameters.t1 - The end of the timespan for the data. t1 can be a maximum of 31 days after t0.
     * @param {number} parameters.timespan - The timespan for which the information will be fetched. If specifying timespan, do not specify parameters t0 and t1. The value must be in seconds and be less than or equal to 31 days. The default is 1 day.
     * @param {integer} parameters.resolution - The time resolution in seconds for returned data. The valid resolutions are: 60, 600, 3600, 86400. The default is 60.
     * @param {string} parameters.uplink - The WAN uplink used to obtain the requested stats. Valid uplinks are wan1, wan2, cellular. The default is wan1.

/**
 * Return the management interface settings for a device
 * @method
 * @name MerakiDashboardApi#getNetworkDeviceManagementInterfaceSettings
 * @param {object} parameters - method options and parameters
     * @param {string} parameters.networkId - The Cisco Meraki Dashboard API is a modern REST API based on the [OpenAPI](https://swagger.io/docs/specification/about/) specification.

## What can the API be used for?
The Dashboard API can be used for many purposes. It's meant to be an open-ended tool. Here are some examples of use cases:

* Add new organizations, admins, networks, devices, VLANs, and more
* Configure networks at scale
* Automatically on-board and off-board new employees' teleworker setups
* Build your own dashboard for store managers, field techs, or unique use cases

## Enabling the Dashboard API
1. Begin by logging into [Meraki Dashboard](https://dashboard.meraki.com) and navigating to **Organization > Settings**

2. Locate the section titled **Dashboard API access** and select **Enable Access**, then **Save** your changes

3. After enabling the API, choose your username at the top-right of the Meraki Dashboard and select **my profile**

4. Locate the section titled **Dashboard API access** and select **Generate new API key**

*Note: The API key is associated with a Dashboard administrator account. You can generate, revoke, and regenerate your API key on your profile.*

**Keep your API key safe as it provides authentication to all of your organizations with the API enabled. If your API key is shared, you can regenerate your API key at any time. This will revoke the existing API key.**

Copy and store your API key in a safe place. Dashboard does not store API keys in plaintext for security reasons, so this is the only time you will be able to record it. If you lose or forget your API key, you will have to revoke it and generate a new one.

Every request must specify an API key via a request header.

The API key must be specified in the URL header. The API will return a 404 (rather than a 403) in response to a request with a missing or incorrect API key in order to prevent leaking the existence of resources to unauthorized users.

## Versioning
Once an API version is released, we will make only backwards-compatible changes to it. Backwards-compatible changes include:

* Adding new API resources

* Adding new optional request parameters to existing API methods

* Adding new properties to existing API responses

* Changing the order of properties in existing API responses

## Rate Limit
* The Dashboard API is limited to **5 calls per second**, per organization.
* A burst of 5 additional calls are allowed in the first second, so a maximum of 15 calls in the first 2 seconds.
* The rate limiting technique is based off of the [token bucket model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Token_bucket).
* An error with a `429` status code will be returned when the rate limit has been exceeded.
* Expect to backoff for 1 - 2 seconds if the limit has been exceeded. You may have to wait potentially longer if a large number of requests were made within this timeframe.


## Additional Details
Identifiers in the API are opaque strings. A `{networkId}`, for example, might be the string "126043", whereas an `{orderId}` might contain characters, such as "4S1234567". Client applications must not try to parse them as numbers. Even identifiers that look like numbers might be too long to encode without loss of precision in Javascript, where the only numeric type is IEEE 754 floating point.

Verbs in the API follow the usual REST conventions:

`GET` returns the value of a resource or a list of resources, depending on whether an identifier is specified. For example, a `GET` of `/organizations` returns a list of organizations, whereas a `GET` of `/organizations/{organizationId}` returns a particular organization.

`POST` adds a new resource, as in a `POST` to `/organizations/{organizationId}/admins`, or performs some other non-idempotent change.

3. After enabling the API, choose your username at the top-right of the Meraki Dashboard and select **my profile**

4. Locate the section titled **Dashboard API access** and select **Generate new API key**

*Note: The API key is associated with a Dashboard administrator account. You can generate, revoke, and regenerate your API key on your profile.*

**Keep your API key safe as it provides authentication to all of your organizations with the API enabled. If your API key is shared, you can regenerate your API key at any time. This will revoke the existing API key.**

Copy and store your API key in a safe place. Dashboard does not store API keys in plaintext for security reasons, so this is the only time you will be able to record it. If you lose or forget your API key, you will have to revoke it and generate a new one.

Every request must specify an API key via a request header.

The API key must be specified in the URL header. The API will return a 404 (rather than a 403) in response to a request with a missing or incorrect API key in order to prevent leaking the existence of resources to unauthorized users.

## Versioning
Once an API version is released, we will make only backwards-compatible changes to it. Backwards-compatible changes include:

* Adding new API resources

* Adding new optional request parameters to existing API methods

* Adding new properties to existing API responses

* Changing the order of properties in existing API responses

## Rate Limit
* The Dashboard API is limited to **5 calls per second**, per organization.
* A burst of 5 additional calls are allowed in the first second, so a maximum of 15 calls in the first 2 seconds.
* The rate limiting technique is based off of the [token bucket model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Token_bucket).
* An error with a `429` status code will be returned when the rate limit has been exceeded.
* Expect to backoff for 1 - 2 seconds if the limit has been exceeded. You may have to wait potentially longer if a large number of requests were made within this timeframe.


## Additional Details
Identifiers in the API are opaque strings. A `{networkId}`, for example, might be the string "126043", whereas an `{orderId}` might contain characters, such as "4S1234567". Client applications must not try to parse them as numbers. Even identifiers that look like numbers might be too long to encode without loss of precision in Javascript, where the only numeric type is IEEE 754 floating point.

Verbs in the API follow the usual REST conventions:

`GET` returns the value of a resource or a list of resources, depending on whether an identifier is specified. For example, a `GET` of `/organizations` returns a list of organizations, whereas a `GET` of `/organizations/{organizationId}` returns a particular organization.

`POST` adds a new resource, as in a `POST` to `/organizations/{organizationId}/admins`, or performs some other non-idempotent change.

`PUT` updates a resource. `PUTs` are idempotent; they update a resource, creating it first if it does not already exist. A `PUT` should specify all the fields of a resource; the API will revert omitted fields to their default value.

`DELETE` removes a resource.

     * @param {string} parameters.serial - The Cisco Meraki Dashboard API is a modern REST API based on the [OpenAPI](https://swagger.io/docs/specification/about/) specification.

## What can the API be used for?
The Dashboard API can be used for many purposes. It's meant to be an open-ended tool. Here are some examples of use cases:

* Add new organizations, admins, networks, devices, VLANs, and more
* Configure networks at scale
* Automatically on-board and off-board new employees' teleworker setups
* Build your own dashboard for store managers, field techs, or unique use cases

* The rate limiting technique is based off of the [token bucket model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Token_bucket).
* An error with a `429` status code will be returned when the rate limit has been exceeded.
* Expect to backoff for 1 - 2 seconds if the limit has been exceeded. You may have to wait potentially longer if a large number of requests were made within this timeframe.


## Additional Details
Identifiers in the API are opaque strings. A `{networkId}`, for example, might be the string "126043", whereas an `{orderId}` might contain characters, such as "4S1234567". Client applications must not try to parse them as numbers. Even identifiers that look like numbers might be too long to encode without loss of precision in Javascript, where the only numeric type is IEEE 754 floating point.

Verbs in the API follow the usual REST conventions:

`GET` returns the value of a resource or a list of resources, depending on whether an identifier is specified. For example, a `GET` of `/organizations` returns a list of organizations, whereas a `GET` of `/organizations/{organizationId}` returns a particular organization.

`POST` adds a new resource, as in a `POST` to `/organizations/{organizationId}/admins`, or performs some other non-idempotent change.

`PUT` updates a resource. `PUTs` are idempotent; they update a resource, creating it first if it does not already exist. A `PUT` should specify all the fields of a resource; the API will revert omitted fields to their default value.

`DELETE` removes a resource.

## What can the API be used for?
The Dashboard API can be used for many purposes. It's meant to be an open-ended tool. Here are some examples of use cases:

* Add new organizations, admins, networks, devices, VLANs, and more
* Configure networks at scale
* Automatically on-board and off-board new employees' teleworker setups
* Build your own dashboard for store managers, field techs, or unique use cases

## Enabling the Dashboard API
1. Begin by logging into [Meraki Dashboard](https://dashboard.meraki.com) and navigating to **Organization > Settings**

2. Locate the section titled **Dashboard API access** and select **Enable Access**, then **Save** your changes

3. After enabling the API, choose your username at the top-right of the Meraki Dashboard and select **my profile**

4. Locate the section titled **Dashboard API access** and select **Generate new API key**

*Note: The API key is associated with a Dashboard administrator account. You can generate, revoke, and regenerate your API key on your profile.*

**Keep your API key safe as it provides authentication to all of your organizations with the API enabled. If your API key is shared, you can regenerate your API key at any time. This will revoke the existing API key.**

Copy and store your API key in a safe place. Dashboard does not store API keys in plaintext for security reasons, so this is the only time you will be able to record it. If you lose or forget your API key, you will have to revoke it and generate a new one.

Every request must specify an API key via a request header.

The API key must be specified in the URL header. The API will return a 404 (rather than a 403) in response to a request with a missing or incorrect API key in order to prevent leaking the existence of resources to unauthorized users.

## Versioning
Once an API version is released, we will make only backwards-compatible changes to it. Backwards-compatible changes include:

* Adding new API resources

* Adding new optional request parameters to existing API methods

* Adding new properties to existing API responses

* Changing the order of properties in existing API responses

## Rate Limit
* The Dashboard API is limited to **5 calls per second**, per organization.
* A burst of 5 additional calls are allowed in the first second, so a maximum of 15 calls in the first 2 seconds.

 * Return the SSID statuses of an access point
 * @method
 * @name MerakiDashboardApi#getNetworkDeviceWirelessStatus
 * @param {object} parameters - method options and parameters
     * @param {string} parameters.networkId - The Cisco Meraki Dashboard API is a modern REST API based on the [OpenAPI](https://swagger.io/docs/specification/about/) specification.

## What can the API be used for?
The Dashboard API can be used for many purposes. It's meant to be an open-ended tool. Here are some examples of use cases:

* Add new organizations, admins, networks, devices, VLANs, and more
* Configure networks at scale
* Automatically on-board and off-board new employees' teleworker setups
* Build your own dashboard for store managers, field techs, or unique use cases

## Enabling the Dashboard API
1. Begin by logging into [Meraki Dashboard](https://dashboard.meraki.com) and navigating to **Organization > Settings**

2. Locate the section titled **Dashboard API access** and select **Enable Access**, then **Save** your changes

3. After enabling the API, choose your username at the top-right of the Meraki Dashboard and select **my profile**

4. Locate the section titled **Dashboard API access** and select **Generate new API key**

*Note: The API key is associated with a Dashboard administrator account. You can generate, revoke, and regenerate your API key on your profile.*

**Keep your API key safe as it provides authentication to all of your organizations with the API enabled. If your API key is shared, you can regenerate your API key at any time. This will revoke the existing API key.**

Copy and store your API key in a safe place. Dashboard does not store API keys in plaintext for security reasons, so this is the only time you will be able to record it. If you lose or forget your API key, you will have to revoke it and generate a new one.

Every request must specify an API key via a request header.

The API key must be specified in the URL header. The API will return a 404 (rather than a 403) in response to a request with a missing or incorrect API key in order to prevent leaking the existence of resources to unauthorized users.

## Versioning
Once an API version is released, we will make only backwards-compatible changes to it. Backwards-compatible changes include:

* Adding new API resources

* Adding new optional request parameters to existing API methods

* Adding new properties to existing API responses

* Changing the order of properties in existing API responses

## Rate Limit
* The Dashboard API is limited to **5 calls per second**, per organization.
* A burst of 5 additional calls are allowed in the first second, so a maximum of 15 calls in the first 2 seconds.
* The rate limiting technique is based off of the [token bucket model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Token_bucket).
* An error with a `429` status code will be returned when the rate limit has been exceeded.
* Expect to backoff for 1 - 2 seconds if the limit has been exceeded. You may have to wait potentially longer if a large number of requests were made within this timeframe.


## Additional Details
Identifiers in the API are opaque strings. A `{networkId}`, for example, might be the string "126043", whereas an `{orderId}` might contain characters, such as "4S1234567". Client applications must not try to parse them as numbers. Even identifiers that look like numbers might be too long to encode without loss of precision in Javascript, where the only numeric type is IEEE 754 floating point.

Verbs in the API follow the usual REST conventions:

`GET` returns the value of a resource or a list of resources, depending on whether an identifier is specified. For example, a `GET` of `/organizations` returns a list of organizations, whereas a `GET` of `/organizations/{organizationId}` returns a particular organization.

`POST` adds a new resource, as in a `POST` to `/organizations/{organizationId}/admins`, or performs some other non-idempotent change.

`PUT` updates a resource. `PUTs` are idempotent; they update a resource, creating it first if it does not already exist. A `PUT` should specify all the fields of a resource; the API will revert omitted fields to their default value.

`DELETE` removes a resource.

* The Dashboard API is limited to **5 calls per second**, per organization.
* A burst of 5 additional calls are allowed in the first second, so a maximum of 15 calls in the first 2 seconds.
* The rate limiting technique is based off of the [token bucket model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Token_bucket).
* An error with a `429` status code will be returned when the rate limit has been exceeded.
* Expect to backoff for 1 - 2 seconds if the limit has been exceeded. You may have to wait potentially longer if a large number of requests were made within this timeframe.


## Additional Details
Identifiers in the API are opaque strings. A `{networkId}`, for example, might be the string "126043", whereas an `{orderId}` might contain characters, such as "4S1234567". Client applications must not try to parse them as numbers. Even identifiers that look like numbers might be too long to encode without loss of precision in Javascript, where the only numeric type is IEEE 754 floating point.

Verbs in the API follow the usual REST conventions:

`GET` returns the value of a resource or a list of resources, depending on whether an identifier is specified. For example, a `GET` of `/organizations` returns a list of organizations, whereas a `GET` of `/organizations/{organizationId}` returns a particular organization.

`POST` adds a new resource, as in a `POST` to `/organizations/{organizationId}/admins`, or performs some other non-idempotent change.

`PUT` updates a resource. `PUTs` are idempotent; they update a resource, creating it first if it does not already exist. A `PUT` should specify all the fields of a resource; the API will revert omitted fields to their default value.

`DELETE` removes a resource.

     * @param {string} parameters.t0 - The beginning of the timespan for the data. The maximum lookback period is 180 days from today.
     * @param {string} parameters.t1 - The end of the timespan for the data. t1 can be a maximum of 7 days after t0.
     * @param {number} parameters.timespan - The timespan for which the information will be fetched. If specifying timespan, do not specify parameters t0 and t1. The value must be in seconds and be less than or equal to 7 days.
     * @param {integer} parameters.ssid - Filter results by SSID
     * @param {integer} parameters.vlan - Filter results by VLAN
     * @param {string} parameters.apTag - Filter results by AP Tag
     * @param {string} parameters.serial - Filter by AP

/**
 * List the appliance services and their accessibility rules
 * @method
 * @name MerakiDashboardApi#getNetworkFirewalledServices
 * @param {object} parameters - method options and parameters
     * @param {string} parameters.networkId - The Cisco Meraki Dashboard API is a modern REST API based on the [OpenAPI](https://swagger.io/docs/specification/about/) specification.

## What can the API be used for?
The Dashboard API can be used for many purposes. It's meant to be an open-ended tool. Here are some examples of use cases:

* Add new organizations, admins, networks, devices, VLANs, and more
* Configure networks at scale
* Automatically on-board and off-board new employees' teleworker setups
* Build your own dashboard for store managers, field techs, or unique use cases

## Enabling the Dashboard API
1. Begin by logging into [Meraki Dashboard](https://dashboard.meraki.com) and navigating to **Organization > Settings**

2. Locate the section titled **Dashboard API access** and select **Enable Access**, then **Save** your changes

3. After enabling the API, choose your username at the top-right of the Meraki Dashboard and select **my profile**

4. Locate the section titled **Dashboard API access** and select **Generate new API key**

*Note: The API key is associated with a Dashboard administrator account. You can generate, revoke, and regenerate your API key on your profile.*

**Keep your API key safe as it provides authentication to all of your organizations with the API enabled. If your API key is shared, you can regenerate your API key at any time. This will revoke the existing API key.**

Copy and store your API key in a safe place. Dashboard does not store API keys in plaintext for security reasons, so this is the only time you will be able to record it. If you lose or forget your API key, you will have to revoke it and generate a new one.

Every request must specify an API key via a request header.

The API key must be specified in the URL header. The API will return a 404 (rather than a 403) in response to a request with a missing or incorrect API key in order to prevent leaking the existence of resources to unauthorized users.

## Versioning
Once an API version is released, we will make only backwards-compatible changes to it. Backwards-compatible changes include:

* Adding new API resources

* Adding new optional request parameters to existing API methods

* Adding new properties to existing API responses

* Changing the order of properties in existing API responses

## Rate Limit
* The Dashboard API is limited to **5 calls per second**, per organization.
* A burst of 5 additional calls are allowed in the first second, so a maximum of 15 calls in the first 2 seconds.

3. After enabling the API, choose your username at the top-right of the Meraki Dashboard and select **my profile**

4. Locate the section titled **Dashboard API access** and select **Generate new API key**

*Note: The API key is associated with a Dashboard administrator account. You can generate, revoke, and regenerate your API key on your profile.*

**Keep your API key safe as it provides authentication to all of your organizations with the API enabled. If your API key is shared, you can regenerate your API key at any time. This will revoke the existing API key.**

Copy and store your API key in a safe place. Dashboard does not store API keys in plaintext for security reasons, so this is the only time you will be able to record it. If you lose or forget your API key, you will have to revoke it and generate a new one.

Every request must specify an API key via a request header.

The API key must be specified in the URL header. The API will return a 404 (rather than a 403) in response to a request with a missing or incorrect API key in order to prevent leaking the existence of resources to unauthorized users.

## Versioning
Once an API version is released, we will make only backwards-compatible changes to it. Backwards-compatible changes include:

* Adding new API resources

* Adding new optional request parameters to existing API methods

* Adding new properties to existing API responses

* Changing the order of properties in existing API responses

## Rate Limit
* The Dashboard API is limited to **5 calls per second**, per organization.
* A burst of 5 additional calls are allowed in the first second, so a maximum of 15 calls in the first 2 seconds.
* The rate limiting technique is based off of the [token bucket model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Token_bucket).
* An error with a `429` status code will be returned when the rate limit has been exceeded.
* Expect to backoff for 1 - 2 seconds if the limit has been exceeded. You may have to wait potentially longer if a large number of requests were made within this timeframe.


## Additional Details
Identifiers in the API are opaque strings. A `{networkId}`, for example, might be the string "126043", whereas an `{orderId}` might contain characters, such as "4S1234567". Client applications must not try to parse them as numbers. Even identifiers that look like numbers might be too long to encode without loss of precision in Javascript, where the only numeric type is IEEE 754 floating point.

Verbs in the API follow the usual REST conventions:

`GET` returns the value of a resource or a list of resources, depending on whether an identifier is specified. For example, a `GET` of `/organizations` returns a list of organizations, whereas a `GET` of `/organizations/{organizationId}` returns a particular organization.

`POST` adds a new resource, as in a `POST` to `/organizations/{organizationId}/admins`, or performs some other non-idempotent change.

`PUT` updates a resource. `PUTs` are idempotent; they update a resource, creating it first if it does not already exist. A `PUT` should specify all the fields of a resource; the API will revert omitted fields to their default value.

`DELETE` removes a resource.

     * @param {string} parameters.networkId - The Cisco Meraki Dashboard API is a modern REST API based on the [OpenAPI](https://swagger.io/docs/specification/about/) specification.

## What can the API be used for?
The Dashboard API can be used for many purposes. It's meant to be an open-ended tool. Here are some examples of use cases:

* Add new organizations, admins, networks, devices, VLANs, and more
* Configure networks at scale
* Automatically on-board and off-board new employees' teleworker setups
* Build your own dashboard for store managers, field techs, or unique use cases

## Enabling the Dashboard API
1. Begin by logging into [Meraki Dashboard](https://dashboard.meraki.com) and navigating to **Organization > Settings**

2. Locate the section titled **Dashboard API access** and select **Enable Access**, then **Save** your changes

3. After enabling the API, choose your username at the top-right of the Meraki Dashboard and select **my profile**

4. Locate the section titled **Dashboard API access** and select **Generate new API key**

*Note: The API key is associated with a Dashboard administrator account. You can generate, revoke, and regenerate your API key on your profile.*

**Keep your API key safe as it provides authentication to all of your organizations with the API enabled. If your API key is shared, you can regenerate your API key at any time. This will revoke the existing API key.**

Copy and store your API key in a safe place. Dashboard does not store API keys in plaintext for security reasons, so this is the only time you will be able to record it. If you lose or forget your API key, you will have to revoke it and generate a new one.

Every request must specify an API key via a request header.

The API key must be specified in the URL header. The API will return a 404 (rather than a 403) in response to a request with a missing or incorrect API key in order to prevent leaking the existence of resources to unauthorized users.

## Versioning
Once an API version is released, we will make only backwards-compatible changes to it. Backwards-compatible changes include:

* Adding new API resources

* Adding new optional request parameters to existing API methods

* Adding new properties to existing API responses

* Changing the order of properties in existing API responses

## Rate Limit
* The Dashboard API is limited to **5 calls per second**, per organization.
* A burst of 5 additional calls are allowed in the first second, so a maximum of 15 calls in the first 2 seconds.
* The rate limiting technique is based off of the [token bucket model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Token_bucket).
* An error with a `429` status code will be returned when the rate limit has been exceeded.
* Expect to backoff for 1 - 2 seconds if the limit has been exceeded. You may have to wait potentially longer if a large number of requests were made within this timeframe.


## Additional Details
Identifiers in the API are opaque strings. A `{networkId}`, for example, might be the string "126043", whereas an `{orderId}` might contain characters, such as "4S1234567". Client applications must not try to parse them as numbers. Even identifiers that look like numbers might be too long to encode without loss of precision in Javascript, where the only numeric type is IEEE 754 floating point.

Verbs in the API follow the usual REST conventions:

`GET` returns the value of a resource or a list of resources, depending on whether an identifier is specified. For example, a `GET` of `/organizations` returns a list of organizations, whereas a `GET` of `/organizations/{organizationId}` returns a particular organization.

`POST` adds a new resource, as in a `POST` to `/organizations/{organizationId}/admins`, or performs some other non-idempotent change.

`PUT` updates a resource. `PUTs` are idempotent; they update a resource, creating it first if it does not already exist. A `PUT` should specify all the fields of a resource; the API will revert omitted fields to their default value.

`DELETE` removes a resource.

## Versioning
Once an API version is released, we will make only backwards-compatible changes to it. Backwards-compatible changes include:

* Adding new API resources

* Adding new optional request parameters to existing API methods

* Adding new properties to existing API responses

* Changing the order of properties in existing API responses

## Rate Limit
* The Dashboard API is limited to **5 calls per second**, per organization.
* A burst of 5 additional calls are allowed in the first second, so a maximum of 15 calls in the first 2 seconds.
* The rate limiting technique is based off of the [token bucket model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Token_bucket).
* An error with a `429` status code will be returned when the rate limit has been exceeded.
* Expect to backoff for 1 - 2 seconds if the limit has been exceeded. You may have to wait potentially longer if a large number of requests were made within this timeframe.


## Additional Details
Identifiers in the API are opaque strings. A `{networkId}`, for example, might be the string "126043", whereas an `{orderId}` might contain characters, such as "4S1234567". Client applications must not try to parse them as numbers. Even identifiers that look like numbers might be too long to encode without loss of precision in Javascript, where the only numeric type is IEEE 754 floating point.

Verbs in the API follow the usual REST conventions:

`GET` returns the value of a resource or a list of resources, depending on whether an identifier is specified. For example, a `GET` of `/organizations` returns a list of organizations, whereas a `GET` of `/organizations/{organizationId}` returns a particular organization.

`POST` adds a new resource, as in a `POST` to `/organizations/{organizationId}/admins`, or performs some other non-idempotent change.

`PUT` updates a resource. `PUTs` are idempotent; they update a resource, creating it first if it does not already exist. A `PUT` should specify all the fields of a resource; the API will revert omitted fields to their default value.

`DELETE` removes a resource.

## What can the API be used for?
The Dashboard API can be used for many purposes. It's meant to be an open-ended tool. Here are some examples of use cases:

* Add new organizations, admins, networks, devices, VLANs, and more
* Configure networks at scale
* Automatically on-board and off-board new employees' teleworker setups
* Build your own dashboard for store managers, field techs, or unique use cases

## Enabling the Dashboard API
1. Begin by logging into [Meraki Dashboard](https://dashboard.meraki.com) and navigating to **Organization > Settings**

2. Locate the section titled **Dashboard API access** and select **Enable Access**, then **Save** your changes

3. After enabling the API, choose your username at the top-right of the Meraki Dashboard and select **my profile**

4. Locate the section titled **Dashboard API access** and select **Generate new API key**

*Note: The API key is associated with a Dashboard administrator account. You can generate, revoke, and regenerate your API key on your profile.*

**Keep your API key safe as it provides authentication to all of your organizations with the API enabled. If your API key is shared, you can regenerate your API key at any time. This will revoke the existing API key.**

Copy and store your API key in a safe place. Dashboard does not store API keys in plaintext for security reasons, so this is the only time you will be able to record it. If you lose or forget your API key, you will have to revoke it and generate a new one.

Every request must specify an API key via a request header.

/**
 * Delete a group policy
 * @method
 * @name MerakiDashboardApi#deleteNetworkGroupPolicy
 * @param {object} parameters - method options and parameters
     * @param {string} parameters.networkId - The Cisco Meraki Dashboard API is a modern REST API based on the [OpenAPI](https://swagger.io/docs/specification/about/) specification.

## What can the API be used for?
The Dashboard API can be used for many purposes. It's meant to be an open-ended tool. Here are some examples of use cases:

* Add new organizations, admins, networks, devices, VLANs, and more
* Configure networks at scale
* Automatically on-board and off-board new employees' teleworker setups
* Build your own dashboard for store managers, field techs, or unique use cases

## Enabling the Dashboard API
1. Begin by logging into [Meraki Dashboard](https://dashboard.meraki.com) and navigating to **Organization > Settings**

2. Locate the section titled **Dashboard API access** and select **Enable Access**, then **Save** your changes

3. After enabling the API, choose your username at the top-right of the Meraki Dashboard and select **my profile**

4. Locate the section titled **Dashboard API access** and select **Generate new API key**

*Note: The API key is associated with a Dashboard administrator account. You can generate, revoke, and regenerate your API key on your profile.*

**Keep your API key safe as it provides authentication to all of your organizations with the API enabled. If your API key is shared, you can regenerate your API key at any time. This will revoke the existing API key.**

Copy and store your API key in a safe place. Dashboard does not store API keys in plaintext for security reasons, so this is the only time you will be able to record it. If you lose or forget your API key, you will have to revoke it and generate a new one.

Every request must specify an API key via a request header.

The API key must be specified in the URL header. The API will return a 404 (rather than a 403) in response to a request with a missing or incorrect API key in order to prevent leaking the existence of resources to unauthorized users.

## Versioning
Once an API version is released, we will make only backwards-compatible changes to it. Backwards-compatible changes include:

* Adding new API resources

* Adding new optional request parameters to existing API methods

* Adding new properties to existing API responses

* Changing the order of properties in existing API responses

## Rate Limit
* The Dashboard API is limited to **5 calls per second**, per organization.
* A burst of 5 additional calls are allowed in the first second, so a maximum of 15 calls in the first 2 seconds.
* The rate limiting technique is based off of the [token bucket model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Token_bucket).
* An error with a `429` status code will be returned when the rate limit has been exceeded.
* Expect to backoff for 1 - 2 seconds if the limit has been exceeded. You may have to wait potentially longer if a large number of requests were made within this timeframe.


## Additional Details
Identifiers in the API are opaque strings. A `{networkId}`, for example, might be the string "126043", whereas an `{orderId}` might contain characters, such as "4S1234567". Client applications must not try to parse them as numbers. Even identifiers that look like numbers might be too long to encode without loss of precision in Javascript, where the only numeric type is IEEE 754 floating point.

Verbs in the API follow the usual REST conventions:

`GET` returns the value of a resource or a list of resources, depending on whether an identifier is specified. For example, a `GET` of `/organizations` returns a list of organizations, whereas a `GET` of `/organizations/{organizationId}` returns a particular organization.

`POST` adds a new resource, as in a `POST` to `/organizations/{organizationId}/admins`, or performs some other non-idempotent change.

`PUT` updates a resource. `PUTs` are idempotent; they update a resource, creating it first if it does not already exist. A `PUT` should specify all the fields of a resource; the API will revert omitted fields to their default value.

`DELETE` removes a resource.

3. After enabling the API, choose your username at the top-right of the Meraki Dashboard and select **my profile**

4. Locate the section titled **Dashboard API access** and select **Generate new API key**

*Note: The API key is associated with a Dashboard administrator account. You can generate, revoke, and regenerate your API key on your profile.*

**Keep your API key safe as it provides authentication to all of your organizations with the API enabled. If your API key is shared, you can regenerate your API key at any time. This will revoke the existing API key.**

Copy and store your API key in a safe place. Dashboard does not store API keys in plaintext for security reasons, so this is the only time you will be able to record it. If you lose or forget your API key, you will have to revoke it and generate a new one.

Every request must specify an API key via a request header.

The API key must be specified in the URL header. The API will return a 404 (rather than a 403) in response to a request with a missing or incorrect API key in order to prevent leaking the existence of resources to unauthorized users.

## Versioning
Once an API version is released, we will make only backwards-compatible changes to it. Backwards-compatible changes include:

* Adding new API resources

* Adding new optional request parameters to existing API methods

* Adding new properties to existing API responses

* Changing the order of properties in existing API responses

## Rate Limit
* The Dashboard API is limited to **5 calls per second**, per organization.
* A burst of 5 additional calls are allowed in the first second, so a maximum of 15 calls in the first 2 seconds.
* The rate limiting technique is based off of the [token bucket model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Token_bucket).
* An error with a `429` status code will be returned when the rate limit has been exceeded.
* Expect to backoff for 1 - 2 seconds if the limit has been exceeded. You may have to wait potentially longer if a large number of requests were made within this timeframe.


## Additional Details
Identifiers in the API are opaque strings. A `{networkId}`, for example, might be the string "126043", whereas an `{orderId}` might contain characters, such as "4S1234567". Client applications must not try to parse them as numbers. Even identifiers that look like numbers might be too long to encode without loss of precision in Javascript, where the only numeric type is IEEE 754 floating point.

Verbs in the API follow the usual REST conventions:

`GET` returns the value of a resource or a list of resources, depending on whether an identifier is specified. For example, a `GET` of `/organizations` returns a list of organizations, whereas a `GET` of `/organizations/{organizationId}` returns a particular organization.

`POST` adds a new resource, as in a `POST` to `/organizations/{organizationId}/admins`, or performs some other non-idempotent change.

`PUT` updates a resource. `PUTs` are idempotent; they update a resource, creating it first if it does not already exist. A `PUT` should specify all the fields of a resource; the API will revert omitted fields to their default value.

`DELETE` removes a resource.

## What can the API be used for?
The Dashboard API can be used for many purposes. It's meant to be an open-ended tool. Here are some examples of use cases:

* Add new organizations, admins, networks, devices, VLANs, and more
* Configure networks at scale
* Automatically on-board and off-board new employees' teleworker setups
* Build your own dashboard for store managers, field techs, or unique use cases

## Enabling the Dashboard API
1. Begin by logging into [Meraki Dashboard](https://dashboard.meraki.com) and navigating to **Organization > Settings**

2. Locate the section titled **Dashboard API access** and select **Enable Access**, then **Save** your changes

3. After enabling the API, choose your username at the top-right of the Meraki Dashboard and select **my profile**

4. Locate the section titled **Dashboard API access** and select **Generate new API key**

*Note: The API key is associated with a Dashboard administrator account. You can generate, revoke, and regenerate your API key on your profile.*

**Keep your API key safe as it provides authentication to all of your organizations with the API enabled. If your API key is shared, you can regenerate your API key at any time. This will revoke the existing API key.**

* The Dashboard API is limited to **5 calls per second**, per organization.
* A burst of 5 additional calls are allowed in the first second, so a maximum of 15 calls in the first 2 seconds.
* The rate limiting technique is based off of the [token bucket model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Token_bucket).
* An error with a `429` status code will be returned when the rate limit has been exceeded.
* Expect to backoff for 1 - 2 seconds if the limit has been exceeded. You may have to wait potentially longer if a large number of requests were made within this timeframe.


## Additional Details
Identifiers in the API are opaque strings. A `{networkId}`, for example, might be the string "126043", whereas an `{orderId}` might contain characters, such as "4S1234567". Client applications must not try to parse them as numbers. Even identifiers that look like numbers might be too long to encode without loss of precision in Javascript, where the only numeric type is IEEE 754 floating point.

Verbs in the API follow the usual REST conventions:

`GET` returns the value of a resource or a list of resources, depending on whether an identifier is specified. For example, a `GET` of `/organizations` returns a list of organizations, whereas a `GET` of `/organizations/{organizationId}` returns a particular organization.

`POST` adds a new resource, as in a `POST` to `/organizations/{organizationId}/admins`, or performs some other non-idempotent change.

`PUT` updates a resource. `PUTs` are idempotent; they update a resource, creating it first if it does not already exist. A `PUT` should specify all the fields of a resource; the API will revert omitted fields to their default value.

`DELETE` removes a resource.

## What can the API be used for?
The Dashboard API can be used for many purposes. It's meant to be an open-ended tool. Here are some examples of use cases:

* Add new organizations, admins, networks, devices, VLANs, and more
* Configure networks at scale
* Automatically on-board and off-board new employees' teleworker setups
* Build your own dashboard for store managers, field techs, or unique use cases

## Enabling the Dashboard API
1. Begin by logging into [Meraki Dashboard](https://dashboard.meraki.com) and navigating to **Organization > Settings**

2. Locate the section titled **Dashboard API access** and select **Enable Access**, then **Save** your changes

3. After enabling the API, choose your username at the top-right of the Meraki Dashboard and select **my profile**

4. Locate the section titled **Dashboard API access** and select **Generate new API key**

*Note: The API key is associated with a Dashboard administrator account. You can generate, revoke, and regenerate your API key on your profile.*

**Keep your API key safe as it provides authentication to all of your organizations with the API enabled. If your API key is shared, you can regenerate your API key at any time. This will revoke the existing API key.**

Copy and store your API key in a safe place. Dashboard does not store API keys in plaintext for security reasons, so this is the only time you will be able to record it. If you lose or forget your API key, you will have to revoke it and generate a new one.

Every request must specify an API key via a request header.

The API key must be specified in the URL header. The API will return a 404 (rather than a 403) in response to a request with a missing or incorrect API key in order to prevent leaking the existence of resources to unauthorized users.

## Versioning
Once an API version is released, we will make only backwards-compatible changes to it. Backwards-compatible changes include:

* Adding new API resources

* Adding new optional request parameters to existing API methods

* Adding new properties to existing API responses

* Changing the order of properties in existing API responses

## Rate Limit

/**
 * List the MX L7 firewall rules for an MX network
 * @method
 * @name MerakiDashboardApi#getNetworkL7FirewallRules
 * @param {object} parameters - method options and parameters
     * @param {string} parameters.networkId - The Cisco Meraki Dashboard API is a modern REST API based on the [OpenAPI](https://swagger.io/docs/specification/about/) specification.

## What can the API be used for?
The Dashboard API can be used for many purposes. It's meant to be an open-ended tool. Here are some examples of use cases:

* Add new organizations, admins, networks, devices, VLANs, and more
* Configure networks at scale
* Automatically on-board and off-board new employees' teleworker setups
* Build your own dashboard for store managers, field techs, or unique use cases

## Enabling the Dashboard API
1. Begin by logging into [Meraki Dashboard](https://dashboard.meraki.com) and navigating to **Organization > Settings**

2. Locate the section titled **Dashboard API access** and select **Enable Access**, then **Save** your changes

3. After enabling the API, choose your username at the top-right of the Meraki Dashboard and select **my profile**

4. Locate the section titled **Dashboard API access** and select **Generate new API key**

*Note: The API key is associated with a Dashboard administrator account. You can generate, revoke, and regenerate your API key on your profile.*

**Keep your API key safe as it provides authentication to all of your organizations with the API enabled. If your API key is shared, you can regenerate your API key at any time. This will revoke the existing API key.**

Copy and store your API key in a safe place. Dashboard does not store API keys in plaintext for security reasons, so this is the only time you will be able to record it. If you lose or forget your API key, you will have to revoke it and generate a new one.

Every request must specify an API key via a request header.

The API key must be specified in the URL header. The API will return a 404 (rather than a 403) in response to a request with a missing or incorrect API key in order to prevent leaking the existence of resources to unauthorized users.

## Versioning
Once an API version is released, we will make only backwards-compatible changes to it. Backwards-compatible changes include:

* Adding new API resources

* Adding new optional request parameters to existing API methods

* Adding new properties to existing API responses

* Changing the order of properties in existing API responses

## Rate Limit
* The Dashboard API is limited to **5 calls per second**, per organization.
* A burst of 5 additional calls are allowed in the first second, so a maximum of 15 calls in the first 2 seconds.
* The rate limiting technique is based off of the [token bucket model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Token_bucket).
* An error with a `429` status code will be returned when the rate limit has been exceeded.
* Expect to backoff for 1 - 2 seconds if the limit has been exceeded. You may have to wait potentially longer if a large number of requests were made within this timeframe.


## Additional Details
Identifiers in the API are opaque strings. A `{networkId}`, for example, might be the string "126043", whereas an `{orderId}` might contain characters, such as "4S1234567". Client applications must not try to parse them as numbers. Even identifiers that look like numbers might be too long to encode without loss of precision in Javascript, where the only numeric type is IEEE 754 floating point.

Verbs in the API follow the usual REST conventions:

`GET` returns the value of a resource or a list of resources, depending on whether an identifier is specified. For example, a `GET` of `/organizations` returns a list of organizations, whereas a `GET` of `/organizations/{organizationId}` returns a particular organization.

`POST` adds a new resource, as in a `POST` to `/organizations/{organizationId}/admins`, or performs some other non-idempotent change.

`PUT` updates a resource. `PUTs` are idempotent; they update a resource, creating it first if it does not already exist. A `PUT` should specify all the fields of a resource; the API will revert omitted fields to their default value.

`DELETE` removes a resource.

/**
 * List the splash or RADIUS users configured under Meraki Authentication for a network
 * @method
 * @name MerakiDashboardApi#getNetworkMerakiAuthUsers
 * @param {object} parameters - method options and parameters
     * @param {string} parameters.networkId - The Cisco Meraki Dashboard API is a modern REST API based on the [OpenAPI](https://swagger.io/docs/specification/about/) specification.

## What can the API be used for?
The Dashboard API can be used for many purposes. It's meant to be an open-ended tool. Here are some examples of use cases:

* Add new organizations, admins, networks, devices, VLANs, and more
* Configure networks at scale
* Automatically on-board and off-board new employees' teleworker setups
* Build your own dashboard for store managers, field techs, or unique use cases

## Enabling the Dashboard API
1. Begin by logging into [Meraki Dashboard](https://dashboard.meraki.com) and navigating to **Organization > Settings**

2. Locate the section titled **Dashboard API access** and select **Enable Access**, then **Save** your changes

3. After enabling the API, choose your username at the top-right of the Meraki Dashboard and select **my profile**

4. Locate the section titled **Dashboard API access** and select **Generate new API key**

*Note: The API key is associated with a Dashboard administrator account. You can generate, revoke, and regenerate your API key on your profile.*

**Keep your API key safe as it provides authentication to all of your organizations with the API enabled. If your API key is shared, you can regenerate your API key at any time. This will revoke the existing API key.**

Copy and store your API key in a safe place. Dashboard does not store API keys in plaintext for security reasons, so this is the only time you will be able to record it. If you lose or forget your API key, you will have to revoke it and generate a new one.

Every request must specify an API key via a request header.

The API key must be specified in the URL header. The API will return a 404 (rather than a 403) in response to a request with a missing or incorrect API key in order to prevent leaking the existence of resources to unauthorized users.

## Versioning
Once an API version is released, we will make only backwards-compatible changes to it. Backwards-compatible changes include:

* Adding new API resources

* Adding new optional request parameters to existing API methods

* Adding new properties to existing API responses

* Changing the order of properties in existing API responses

## Rate Limit
* The Dashboard API is limited to **5 calls per second**, per organization.
* A burst of 5 additional calls are allowed in the first second, so a maximum of 15 calls in the first 2 seconds.
* The rate limiting technique is based off of the [token bucket model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Token_bucket).
* An error with a `429` status code will be returned when the rate limit has been exceeded.
* Expect to backoff for 1 - 2 seconds if the limit has been exceeded. You may have to wait potentially longer if a large number of requests were made within this timeframe.


## Additional Details
Identifiers in the API are opaque strings. A `{networkId}`, for example, might be the string "126043", whereas an `{orderId}` might contain characters, such as "4S1234567". Client applications must not try to parse them as numbers. Even identifiers that look like numbers might be too long to encode without loss of precision in Javascript, where the only numeric type is IEEE 754 floating point.

Verbs in the API follow the usual REST conventions:

`GET` returns the value of a resource or a list of resources, depending on whether an identifier is specified. For example, a `GET` of `/organizations` returns a list of organizations, whereas a `GET` of `/organizations/{organizationId}` returns a particular organization.

`POST` adds a new resource, as in a `POST` to `/organizations/{organizationId}/admins`, or performs some other non-idempotent change.

`PUT` updates a resource. `PUTs` are idempotent; they update a resource, creating it first if it does not already exist. A `PUT` should specify all the fields of a resource; the API will revert omitted fields to their default value.

`DELETE` removes a resource.

     * @param {string} parameters.networkId - The Cisco Meraki Dashboard API is a modern REST API based on the [OpenAPI](https://swagger.io/docs/specification/about/) specification.

## What can the API be used for?
The Dashboard API can be used for many purposes. It's meant to be an open-ended tool. Here are some examples of use cases:

* Add new organizations, admins, networks, devices, VLANs, and more
* Configure networks at scale
* Automatically on-board and off-board new employees' teleworker setups
* Build your own dashboard for store managers, field techs, or unique use cases

## Enabling the Dashboard API
1. Begin by logging into [Meraki Dashboard](https://dashboard.meraki.com) and navigating to **Organization > Settings**

2. Locate the section titled **Dashboard API access** and select **Enable Access**, then **Save** your changes

3. After enabling the API, choose your username at the top-right of the Meraki Dashboard and select **my profile**

4. Locate the section titled **Dashboard API access** and select **Generate new API key**

*Note: The API key is associated with a Dashboard administrator account. You can generate, revoke, and regenerate your API key on your profile.*

**Keep your API key safe as it provides authentication to all of your organizations with the API enabled. If your API key is shared, you can regenerate your API key at any time. This will revoke the existing API key.**

Copy and store your API key in a safe place. Dashboard does not store API keys in plaintext for security reasons, so this is the only time you will be able to record it. If you lose or forget your API key, you will have to revoke it and generate a new one.

Every request must specify an API key via a request header.

The API key must be specified in the URL header. The API will return a 404 (rather than a 403) in response to a request with a missing or incorrect API key in order to prevent leaking the existence of resources to unauthorized users.

## Versioning
Once an API version is released, we will make only backwards-compatible changes to it. Backwards-compatible changes include:

* Adding new API resources

* Adding new optional request parameters to existing API methods

* Adding new properties to existing API responses

* Changing the order of properties in existing API responses

## Rate Limit
* The Dashboard API is limited to **5 calls per second**, per organization.
* A burst of 5 additional calls are allowed in the first second, so a maximum of 15 calls in the first 2 seconds.
* The rate limiting technique is based off of the [token bucket model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Token_bucket).
* An error with a `429` status code will be returned when the rate limit has been exceeded.
* Expect to backoff for 1 - 2 seconds if the limit has been exceeded. You may have to wait potentially longer if a large number of requests were made within this timeframe.


## Additional Details
Identifiers in the API are opaque strings. A `{networkId}`, for example, might be the string "126043", whereas an `{orderId}` might contain characters, such as "4S1234567". Client applications must not try to parse them as numbers. Even identifiers that look like numbers might be too long to encode without loss of precision in Javascript, where the only numeric type is IEEE 754 floating point.

Verbs in the API follow the usual REST conventions:

`GET` returns the value of a resource or a list of resources, depending on whether an identifier is specified. For example, a `GET` of `/organizations` returns a list of organizations, whereas a `GET` of `/organizations/{organizationId}` returns a particular organization.

`POST` adds a new resource, as in a `POST` to `/organizations/{organizationId}/admins`, or performs some other non-idempotent change.

`PUT` updates a resource. `PUTs` are idempotent; they update a resource, creating it first if it does not already exist. A `PUT` should specify all the fields of a resource; the API will revert omitted fields to their default value.

`DELETE` removes a resource.

## Enabling the Dashboard API
1. Begin by logging into [Meraki Dashboard](https://dashboard.meraki.com) and navigating to **Organization > Settings**

2. Locate the section titled **Dashboard API access** and select **Enable Access**, then **Save** your changes

3. After enabling the API, choose your username at the top-right of the Meraki Dashboard and select **my profile**

4. Locate the section titled **Dashboard API access** and select **Generate new API key**

*Note: The API key is associated with a Dashboard administrator account. You can generate, revoke, and regenerate your API key on your profile.*

**Keep your API key safe as it provides authentication to all of your organizations with the API enabled. If your API key is shared, you can regenerate your API key at any time. This will revoke the existing API key.**

Copy and store your API key in a safe place. Dashboard does not store API keys in plaintext for security reasons, so this is the only time you will be able to record it. If you lose or forget your API key, you will have to revoke it and generate a new one.

Every request must specify an API key via a request header.

The API key must be specified in the URL header. The API will return a 404 (rather than a 403) in response to a request with a missing or incorrect API key in order to prevent leaking the existence of resources to unauthorized users.

## Versioning
Once an API version is released, we will make only backwards-compatible changes to it. Backwards-compatible changes include:

* Adding new API resources

* Adding new optional request parameters to existing API methods

* Adding new properties to existing API responses

* Changing the order of properties in existing API responses

## Rate Limit
* The Dashboard API is limited to **5 calls per second**, per organization.
* A burst of 5 additional calls are allowed in the first second, so a maximum of 15 calls in the first 2 seconds.
* The rate limiting technique is based off of the [token bucket model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Token_bucket).
* An error with a `429` status code will be returned when the rate limit has been exceeded.
* Expect to backoff for 1 - 2 seconds if the limit has been exceeded. You may have to wait potentially longer if a large number of requests were made within this timeframe.


## Additional Details
Identifiers in the API are opaque strings. A `{networkId}`, for example, might be the string "126043", whereas an `{orderId}` might contain characters, such as "4S1234567". Client applications must not try to parse them as numbers. Even identifiers that look like numbers might be too long to encode without loss of precision in Javascript, where the only numeric type is IEEE 754 floating point.

Verbs in the API follow the usual REST conventions:

`GET` returns the value of a resource or a list of resources, depending on whether an identifier is specified. For example, a `GET` of `/organizations` returns a list of organizations, whereas a `GET` of `/organizations/{organizationId}` returns a particular organization.

`POST` adds a new resource, as in a `POST` to `/organizations/{organizationId}/admins`, or performs some other non-idempotent change.

`PUT` updates a resource. `PUTs` are idempotent; they update a resource, creating it first if it does not already exist. A `PUT` should specify all the fields of a resource; the API will revert omitted fields to their default value.

`DELETE` removes a resource.

```
 * @method
 * @name MerakiDashboardApi#deleteNetworkPiiRequest
 * @param {object} parameters - method options and parameters
     * @param {string} parameters.networkId - The Cisco Meraki Dashboard API is a modern REST API based on the [OpenAPI](https://swagger.io/docs/specification/about/) specification.

## What can the API be used for?
The Dashboard API can be used for many purposes. It's meant to be an open-ended tool. Here are some examples of use cases:

* Add new organizations, admins, networks, devices, VLANs, and more
* Configure networks at scale
* Automatically on-board and off-board new employees' teleworker setups
* Build your own dashboard for store managers, field techs, or unique use cases

## Enabling the Dashboard API
1. Begin by logging into [Meraki Dashboard](https://dashboard.meraki.com) and navigating to **Organization > Settings**

2. Locate the section titled **Dashboard API access** and select **Enable Access**, then **Save** your changes

3. After enabling the API, choose your username at the top-right of the Meraki Dashboard and select **my profile**

4. Locate the section titled **Dashboard API access** and select **Generate new API key**

*Note: The API key is associated with a Dashboard administrator account. You can generate, revoke, and regenerate your API key on your profile.*

**Keep your API key safe as it provides authentication to all of your organizations with the API enabled. If your API key is shared, you can regenerate your API key at any time. This will revoke the existing API key.**

Copy and store your API key in a safe place. Dashboard does not store API keys in plaintext for security reasons, so this is the only time you will be able to record it. If you lose or forget your API key, you will have to revoke it and generate a new one.

Every request must specify an API key via a request header.

The API key must be specified in the URL header. The API will return a 404 (rather than a 403) in response to a request with a missing or incorrect API key in order to prevent leaking the existence of resources to unauthorized users.

`X-Cisco-Meraki-API-Key: <secret key>`

Read more about API [authorization](../api/#/python/getting-started/authorizing-your-client)


## Versioning
Once an API version is released, we will make only backwards-compatible changes to it. Backwards-compatible changes include:

* Adding new API resources

* Adding new optional request parameters to existing API methods

* Adding new properties to existing API responses

* Changing the order of properties in existing API responses

## Rate Limit
* The Dashboard API is limited to **5 calls per second**, per organization.
* A burst of 5 additional calls are allowed in the first second, so a maximum of 15 calls in the first 2 seconds.
* The rate limiting technique is based off of the [token bucket model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Token_bucket).
* An error with a `429` status code will be returned when the rate limit has been exceeded.
* Expect to backoff for 1 - 2 seconds if the limit has been exceeded. You may have to wait potentially longer if a large number of requests were made within this timeframe.


## Additional Details
Identifiers in the API are opaque strings. A `{networkId}`, for example, might be the string "126043", whereas an `{orderId}` might contain characters, such as "4S1234567". Client applications must not try to parse them as numbers. Even identifiers that look like numbers might be too long to encode without loss of precision in Javascript, where the only numeric type is IEEE 754 floating point.

Verbs in the API follow the usual REST conventions:

`GET` returns the value of a resource or a list of resources, depending on whether an identifier is specified. For example, a `GET` of `/organizations` returns a list of organizations, whereas a `GET` of `/organizations/{organizationId}` returns a particular organization.

`POST` adds a new resource, as in a `POST` to `/organizations/{organizationId}/admins`, or performs some other non-idempotent change.

`PUT` updates a resource. `PUTs` are idempotent; they update a resource, creating it first if it does not already exist. A `PUT` should specify all the fields of a resource; the API will revert omitted fields to their default value.

`DELETE` removes a resource.

Once an API version is released, we will make only backwards-compatible changes to it. Backwards-compatible changes include:

* Adding new API resources

* Adding new optional request parameters to existing API methods

* Adding new properties to existing API responses

* Changing the order of properties in existing API responses

## Rate Limit
* The Dashboard API is limited to **5 calls per second**, per organization.
* A burst of 5 additional calls are allowed in the first second, so a maximum of 15 calls in the first 2 seconds.
* The rate limiting technique is based off of the [token bucket model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Token_bucket).
* An error with a `429` status code will be returned when the rate limit has been exceeded.
* Expect to backoff for 1 - 2 seconds if the limit has been exceeded. You may have to wait potentially longer if a large number of requests were made within this timeframe.


## Additional Details
Identifiers in the API are opaque strings. A `{networkId}`, for example, might be the string "126043", whereas an `{orderId}` might contain characters, such as "4S1234567". Client applications must not try to parse them as numbers. Even identifiers that look like numbers might be too long to encode without loss of precision in Javascript, where the only numeric type is IEEE 754 floating point.

Verbs in the API follow the usual REST conventions:

`GET` returns the value of a resource or a list of resources, depending on whether an identifier is specified. For example, a `GET` of `/organizations` returns a list of organizations, whereas a `GET` of `/organizations/{organizationId}` returns a particular organization.

`POST` adds a new resource, as in a `POST` to `/organizations/{organizationId}/admins`, or performs some other non-idempotent change.

`PUT` updates a resource. `PUTs` are idempotent; they update a resource, creating it first if it does not already exist. A `PUT` should specify all the fields of a resource; the API will revert omitted fields to their default value.

`DELETE` removes a resource.

## What can the API be used for?
The Dashboard API can be used for many purposes. It's meant to be an open-ended tool. Here are some examples of use cases:

* Add new organizations, admins, networks, devices, VLANs, and more
* Configure networks at scale
* Automatically on-board and off-board new employees' teleworker setups
* Build your own dashboard for store managers, field techs, or unique use cases

## Enabling the Dashboard API
1. Begin by logging into [Meraki Dashboard](https://dashboard.meraki.com) and navigating to **Organization > Settings**

2. Locate the section titled **Dashboard API access** and select **Enable Access**, then **Save** your changes

3. After enabling the API, choose your username at the top-right of the Meraki Dashboard and select **my profile**

4. Locate the section titled **Dashboard API access** and select **Generate new API key**

*Note: The API key is associated with a Dashboard administrator account. You can generate, revoke, and regenerate your API key on your profile.*

**Keep your API key safe as it provides authentication to all of your organizations with the API enabled. If your API key is shared, you can regenerate your API key at any time. This will revoke the existing API key.**

Copy and store your API key in a safe place. Dashboard does not store API keys in plaintext for security reasons, so this is the only time you will be able to record it. If you lose or forget your API key, you will have to revoke it and generate a new one.

Every request must specify an API key via a request header.

The API key must be specified in the URL header. The API will return a 404 (rather than a 403) in response to a request with a missing or incorrect API key in order to prevent leaking the existence of resources to unauthorized users.

## Additional Details
Identifiers in the API are opaque strings. A `{networkId}`, for example, might be the string "126043", whereas an `{orderId}` might contain characters, such as "4S1234567". Client applications must not try to parse them as numbers. Even identifiers that look like numbers might be too long to encode without loss of precision in Javascript, where the only numeric type is IEEE 754 floating point.

Verbs in the API follow the usual REST conventions:

`GET` returns the value of a resource or a list of resources, depending on whether an identifier is specified. For example, a `GET` of `/organizations` returns a list of organizations, whereas a `GET` of `/organizations/{organizationId}` returns a particular organization.

`POST` adds a new resource, as in a `POST` to `/organizations/{organizationId}/admins`, or performs some other non-idempotent change.

`PUT` updates a resource. `PUTs` are idempotent; they update a resource, creating it first if it does not already exist. A `PUT` should specify all the fields of a resource; the API will revert omitted fields to their default value.

`DELETE` removes a resource.

 * Set the supported malware settings for an MX network

 * @param {object} parameters - method options and parameters
     * @param {string} parameters.networkId - The Cisco Meraki Dashboard API is a modern REST API based on the [OpenAPI](https://swagger.io/docs/specification/about/) specification.

## What can the API be used for?
The Dashboard API can be used for many purposes. It's meant to be an open-ended tool. Here are some examples of use cases:

* Add new organizations, admins, networks, devices, VLANs, and more
* Configure networks at scale
* Automatically on-board and off-board new employees' teleworker setups
* Build your own dashboard for store managers, field techs, or unique use cases

## Enabling the Dashboard API
1. Begin by logging into [Meraki Dashboard](https://dashboard.meraki.com) and navigating to **Organization > Settings**

2. Locate the section titled **Dashboard API access** and select **Enable Access**, then **Save** your changes

3. After enabling the API, choose your username at the top-right of the Meraki Dashboard and select **my profile**

4. Locate the section titled **Dashboard API access** and select **Generate new API key**

*Note: The API key is associated with a Dashboard administrator account. You can generate, revoke, and regenerate your API key on your profile.*

**Keep your API key safe as it provides authentication to all of your organizations with the API enabled. If your API key is shared, you can regenerate your API key at any time. This will revoke the existing API key.**

Copy and store your API key in a safe place. Dashboard does not store API keys in plaintext for security reasons, so this is the only time you will be able to record it. If you lose or forget your API key, you will have to revoke it and generate a new one.

Every request must specify an API key via a request header.

The API key must be specified in the URL header. The API will return a 404 (rather than a 403) in response to a request with a missing or incorrect API key in order to prevent leaking the existence of resources to unauthorized users.

## Versioning
Once an API version is released, we will make only backwards-compatible changes to it. Backwards-compatible changes include:

* Adding new API resources

* Adding new optional request parameters to existing API methods

* Adding new properties to existing API responses

* Changing the order of properties in existing API responses

## Rate Limit
* The Dashboard API is limited to **5 calls per second**, per organization.
* A burst of 5 additional calls are allowed in the first second, so a maximum of 15 calls in the first 2 seconds.
* The rate limiting technique is based off of the [token bucket model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Token_bucket).
* An error with a `429` status code will be returned when the rate limit has been exceeded.
* Expect to backoff for 1 - 2 seconds if the limit has been exceeded. You may have to wait potentially longer if a large number of requests were made within this timeframe.

`PUT` updates a resource. `PUTs` are idempotent; they update a resource, creating it first if it does not already exist. A `PUT` should specify all the fields of a resource; the API will revert omitted fields to their default value.

`DELETE` removes a resource.

     * @param {} parameters.updateNetworkSiteToSiteVpn - The Cisco Meraki Dashboard API is a modern REST API based on the [OpenAPI](https://swagger.io/docs/specification/about/) specification.

## What can the API be used for?
The Dashboard API can be used for many purposes. It's meant to be an open-ended tool. Here are some examples of use cases:

* Add new organizations, admins, networks, devices, VLANs, and more
* Configure networks at scale
* Automatically on-board and off-board new employees' teleworker setups
* Build your own dashboard for store managers, field techs, or unique use cases

## Enabling the Dashboard API
1. Begin by logging into [Meraki Dashboard](https://dashboard.meraki.com) and navigating to **Organization > Settings**

2. Locate the section titled **Dashboard API access** and select **Enable Access**, then **Save** your changes

3. After enabling the API, choose your username at the top-right of the Meraki Dashboard and select **my profile**

4. Locate the section titled **Dashboard API access** and select **Generate new API key**

*Note: The API key is associated with a Dashboard administrator account. You can generate, revoke, and regenerate your API key on your profile.*

**Keep your API key safe as it provides authentication to all of your organizations with the API enabled. If your API key is shared, you can regenerate your API key at any time. This will revoke the existing API key.**

Copy and store your API key in a safe place. Dashboard does not store API keys in plaintext for security reasons, so this is the only time you will be able to record it. If you lose or forget your API key, you will have to revoke it and generate a new one.

Every request must specify an API key via a request header.

The API key must be specified in the URL header. The API will return a 404 (rather than a 403) in response to a request with a missing or incorrect API key in order to prevent leaking the existence of resources to unauthorized users.

## Versioning
Once an API version is released, we will make only backwards-compatible changes to it. Backwards-compatible changes include:

* Adding new API resources

* Adding new optional request parameters to existing API methods

* Adding new properties to existing API responses

* Changing the order of properties in existing API responses

## Rate Limit
* The Dashboard API is limited to **5 calls per second**, per organization.
* A burst of 5 additional calls are allowed in the first second, so a maximum of 15 calls in the first 2 seconds.
* The rate limiting technique is based off of the [token bucket model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Token_bucket).
* An error with a `429` status code will be returned when the rate limit has been exceeded.
* Expect to backoff for 1 - 2 seconds if the limit has been exceeded. You may have to wait potentially longer if a large number of requests were made within this timeframe.


## Additional Details
Identifiers in the API are opaque strings. A `{networkId}`, for example, might be the string "126043", whereas an `{orderId}` might contain characters, such as "4S1234567". Client applications must not try to parse them as numbers. Even identifiers that look like numbers might be too long to encode without loss of precision in Javascript, where the only numeric type is IEEE 754 floating point.

Verbs in the API follow the usual REST conventions:

`GET` returns the value of a resource or a list of resources, depending on whether an identifier is specified. For example, a `GET` of `/organizations` returns a list of organizations, whereas a `GET` of `/organizations/{organizationId}` returns a particular organization.

`POST` adds a new resource, as in a `POST` to `/organizations/{organizationId}/admins`, or performs some other non-idempotent change.

`PUT` updates a resource. `PUTs` are idempotent; they update a resource, creating it first if it does not already exist. A `PUT` should specify all the fields of a resource; the API will revert omitted fields to their default value.

`DELETE` removes a resource.

1. Begin by logging into [Meraki Dashboard](https://dashboard.meraki.com) and navigating to **Organization > Settings**

2. Locate the section titled **Dashboard API access** and select **Enable Access**, then **Save** your changes

3. After enabling the API, choose your username at the top-right of the Meraki Dashboard and select **my profile**

4. Locate the section titled **Dashboard API access** and select **Generate new API key**

*Note: The API key is associated with a Dashboard administrator account. You can generate, revoke, and regenerate your API key on your profile.*

**Keep your API key safe as it provides authentication to all of your organizations with the API enabled. If your API key is shared, you can regenerate your API key at any time. This will revoke the existing API key.**

Copy and store your API key in a safe place. Dashboard does not store API keys in plaintext for security reasons, so this is the only time you will be able to record it. If you lose or forget your API key, you will have to revoke it and generate a new one.

Every request must specify an API key via a request header.

The API key must be specified in the URL header. The API will return a 404 (rather than a 403) in response to a request with a missing or incorrect API key in order to prevent leaking the existence of resources to unauthorized users.

## Versioning
Once an API version is released, we will make only backwards-compatible changes to it. Backwards-compatible changes include:

* Adding new API resources

* Adding new optional request parameters to existing API methods

* Adding new properties to existing API responses

* Changing the order of properties in existing API responses

## Rate Limit
* The Dashboard API is limited to **5 calls per second**, per organization.
* A burst of 5 additional calls are allowed in the first second, so a maximum of 15 calls in the first 2 seconds.
* The rate limiting technique is based off of the [token bucket model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Token_bucket).
* An error with a `429` status code will be returned when the rate limit has been exceeded.
* Expect to backoff for 1 - 2 seconds if the limit has been exceeded. You may have to wait potentially longer if a large number of requests were made within this timeframe.


## Additional Details
Identifiers in the API are opaque strings. A `{networkId}`, for example, might be the string "126043", whereas an `{orderId}` might contain characters, such as "4S1234567". Client applications must not try to parse them as numbers. Even identifiers that look like numbers might be too long to encode without loss of precision in Javascript, where the only numeric type is IEEE 754 floating point.

Verbs in the API follow the usual REST conventions:

`GET` returns the value of a resource or a list of resources, depending on whether an identifier is specified. For example, a `GET` of `/organizations` returns a list of organizations, whereas a `GET` of `/organizations/{organizationId}` returns a particular organization.

`POST` adds a new resource, as in a `POST` to `/organizations/{organizationId}/admins`, or performs some other non-idempotent change.

`PUT` updates a resource. `PUTs` are idempotent; they update a resource, creating it first if it does not already exist. A `PUT` should specify all the fields of a resource; the API will revert omitted fields to their default value.

`DELETE` removes a resource.

The API key must be specified in the URL header. The API will return a 404 (rather than a 403) in response to a request with a missing or incorrect API key in order to prevent leaking the existence of resources to unauthorized users.

## Versioning
Once an API version is released, we will make only backwards-compatible changes to it. Backwards-compatible changes include:

* Adding new API resources

* Adding new optional request parameters to existing API methods

* Adding new properties to existing API responses

* Changing the order of properties in existing API responses

## Rate Limit
* The Dashboard API is limited to **5 calls per second**, per organization.
* A burst of 5 additional calls are allowed in the first second, so a maximum of 15 calls in the first 2 seconds.
* The rate limiting technique is based off of the [token bucket model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Token_bucket).
* An error with a `429` status code will be returned when the rate limit has been exceeded.
* Expect to backoff for 1 - 2 seconds if the limit has been exceeded. You may have to wait potentially longer if a large number of requests were made within this timeframe.


## Additional Details
Identifiers in the API are opaque strings. A `{networkId}`, for example, might be the string "126043", whereas an `{orderId}` might contain characters, such as "4S1234567". Client applications must not try to parse them as numbers. Even identifiers that look like numbers might be too long to encode without loss of precision in Javascript, where the only numeric type is IEEE 754 floating point.

Verbs in the API follow the usual REST conventions:

`GET` returns the value of a resource or a list of resources, depending on whether an identifier is specified. For example, a `GET` of `/organizations` returns a list of organizations, whereas a `GET` of `/organizations/{organizationId}` returns a particular organization.

`POST` adds a new resource, as in a `POST` to `/organizations/{organizationId}/admins`, or performs some other non-idempotent change.

`PUT` updates a resource. `PUTs` are idempotent; they update a resource, creating it first if it does not already exist. A `PUT` should specify all the fields of a resource; the API will revert omitted fields to their default value.

`DELETE` removes a resource.

## What can the API be used for?
The Dashboard API can be used for many purposes. It's meant to be an open-ended tool. Here are some examples of use cases:

* Add new organizations, admins, networks, devices, VLANs, and more
* Configure networks at scale
* Automatically on-board and off-board new employees' teleworker setups
* Build your own dashboard for store managers, field techs, or unique use cases

## Enabling the Dashboard API
1. Begin by logging into [Meraki Dashboard](https://dashboard.meraki.com) and navigating to **Organization > Settings**

2. Locate the section titled **Dashboard API access** and select **Enable Access**, then **Save** your changes

3. After enabling the API, choose your username at the top-right of the Meraki Dashboard and select **my profile**

4. Locate the section titled **Dashboard API access** and select **Generate new API key**

*Note: The API key is associated with a Dashboard administrator account. You can generate, revoke, and regenerate your API key on your profile.*

**Keep your API key safe as it provides authentication to all of your organizations with the API enabled. If your API key is shared, you can regenerate your API key at any time. This will revoke the existing API key.**

Copy and store your API key in a safe place. Dashboard does not store API keys in plaintext for security reasons, so this is the only time you will be able to record it. If you lose or forget your API key, you will have to revoke it and generate a new one.

Even identifiers that look like numbers might be too long to encode without loss of precision in Javascript, where the only numeric type is IEEE 754 floating point.

Verbs in the API follow the usual REST conventions:

`GET` returns the value of a resource or a list of resources, depending on whether an identifier is specified. For example, a `GET` of `/organizations` returns a list of organizations, whereas a `GET` of `/organizations/{organizationId}` returns a particular organization.

`POST` adds a new resource, as in a `POST` to `/organizations/{organizationId}/admins`, or performs some other non-idempotent change.

`PUT` updates a resource. `PUTs` are idempotent; they update a resource, creating it first if it does not already exist. A `PUT` should specify all the fields of a resource; the API will revert omitted fields to their default value.

`DELETE` removes a resource.

/**
 * List the devices enrolled in an SM network with various specified fields and filters
 * @method
 * @name MerakiDashboardApi#getNetworkSmDevices
 * @param {object} parameters - method options and parameters
     * @param {string} parameters.networkId - The Cisco Meraki Dashboard API is a modern REST API based on the [OpenAPI](https://swagger.io/docs/specification/about/) specification.

## What can the API be used for?
The Dashboard API can be used for many purposes. It's meant to be an open-ended tool. Here are some examples of use cases:

* Add new organizations, admins, networks, devices, VLANs, and more
* Configure networks at scale
* Automatically on-board and off-board new employees' teleworker setups
* Build your own dashboard for store managers, field techs, or unique use cases

## Enabling the Dashboard API
1. Begin by logging into [Meraki Dashboard](https://dashboard.meraki.com) and navigating to **Organization > Settings**

2. Locate the section titled **Dashboard API access** and select **Enable Access**, then **Save** your changes

3. After enabling the API, choose your username at the top-right of the Meraki Dashboard and select **my profile**

4. Locate the section titled **Dashboard API access** and select **Generate new API key**

*Note: The API key is associated with a Dashboard administrator account. You can generate, revoke, and regenerate your API key on your profile.*

**Keep your API key safe as it provides authentication to all of your organizations with the API enabled. If your API key is shared, you can regenerate your API key at any time. This will revoke the existing API key.**

Copy and store your API key in a safe place. Dashboard does not store API keys in plaintext for security reasons, so this is the only time you will be able to record it. If you lose or forget your API key, you will have to revoke it and generate a new one.

Every request must specify an API key via a request header.

The API key must be specified in the URL header. The API will return a 404 (rather than a 403) in response to a request with a missing or incorrect API key in order to prevent leaking the existence of resources to unauthorized users.

## Versioning
Once an API version is released, we will make only backwards-compatible changes to it. Backwards-compatible changes include:

* Adding new API resources

* Adding new optional request parameters to existing API methods

* Adding new properties to existing API responses

* Changing the order of properties in existing API responses

## Rate Limit
* The Dashboard API is limited to **5 calls per second**, per organization.
* A burst of 5 additional calls are allowed in the first second, so a maximum of 15 calls in the first 2 seconds.
* The rate limiting technique is based off of the [token bucket model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Token_bucket).
* An error with a `429` status code will be returned when the rate limit has been exceeded.
* Expect to backoff for 1 - 2 seconds if the limit has been exceeded. You may have to wait potentially longer if a large number of requests were made within this timeframe.


## Additional Details
Identifiers in the API are opaque strings. A `{networkId}`, for example, might be the string "126043", whereas an `{orderId}` might contain characters, such as "4S1234567". Client applications must not try to parse them as numbers. Even identifiers that look like numbers might be too long to encode without loss of precision in Javascript, where the only numeric type is IEEE 754 floating point.

Verbs in the API follow the usual REST conventions:

`GET` returns the value of a resource or a list of resources, depending on whether an identifier is specified. For example, a `GET` of `/organizations` returns a list of organizations, whereas a `GET` of `/organizations/{organizationId}` returns a particular organization.

`POST` adds a new resource, as in a `POST` to `/organizations/{organizationId}/admins`, or performs some other non-idempotent change.

`PUT` updates a resource. `PUTs` are idempotent; they update a resource, creating it first if it does not already exist. A `PUT` should specify all the fields of a resource; the API will revert omitted fields to their default value.

`DELETE` removes a resource.

     * @param {string} parameters.fields - Additional fields that will be displayed for each device. Multiple fields can be passed in as comma separated values.
    The default fields are: id, name, tags, ssid, wifiMac, osName, systemModel, uuid, and serialNumber. The additional fields are: ip,
    systemType, availableDeviceCapacity, kioskAppName, biosVersion, lastConnected, missingAppsCount, userSuppliedAddress, location, lastUser,
    ownerEmail, ownerUsername, publicIp, phoneNumber, diskInfoJson, deviceCapacity, isManaged, hadMdm, isSupervised, meid, imei, iccid,
    simCarrierNetwork, cellularDataUsed, isHotspotEnabled, createdAt, batteryEstCharge, quarantined, avName, avRunning, asName, fwName,
    isRooted, loginRequired, screenLockEnabled, screenLockDelay, autoLoginDisabled, autoTags, hasMdm, hasDesktopAgent, diskEncryptionEnabled,
    hardwareEncryptionCaps, passCodeLock, usesHardwareKeystore, and androidSecurityPatchVersion.
     * @param {string} parameters.wifiMacs - Filter devices by wifi mac(s). Multiple wifi macs can be passed in as comma separated values.
     * @param {string} parameters.serials - Filter devices by serial(s). Multiple serials can be passed in as comma separated values.
     * @param {string} parameters.ids - Filter devices by id(s). Multiple ids can be passed in as comma separated values.
     * @param {string} parameters.scope - Specify a scope (one of all, none, withAny, withAll, withoutAny, or withoutAll) and a set of tags as comma separated values.
     * @param {integer} parameters.batchSize - Number of devices to return, 1000 is the default as well as the max.
     * @param {string} parameters.batchToken - If the network has more devices than the batch size, a batch token will be returned
    as a part of the device list. To see the remainder of the devices, pass in the batchToken as a parameter in the next request.
    Requests made with the batchToken do not require additional parameters as the batchToken includes the parameters passed in
    with the original request. Additional parameters passed in with the batchToken will be ignored.

/**
 * Add, delete, or update the tags of a set of devices
 * @method
 * @name MerakiDashboardApi#updateNetworkSmDevicesTags
 * @param {object} parameters - method options and parameters
     * @param {string} parameters.networkId - The Cisco Meraki Dashboard API is a modern REST API based on the [OpenAPI](https://swagger.io/docs/specification/about/) specification.

## What can the API be used for?
The Dashboard API can be used for many purposes. It's meant to be an open-ended tool. Here are some examples of use cases:

* Add new organizations, admins, networks, devices, VLANs, and more
* Configure networks at scale
* Automatically on-board and off-board new employees' teleworker setups
* Build your own dashboard for store managers, field techs, or unique use cases

## Enabling the Dashboard API
1. Begin by logging into [Meraki Dashboard](https://dashboard.meraki.com) and navigating to **Organization > Settings**

2. Locate the section titled **Dashboard API access** and select **Enable Access**, then **Save** your changes

3. After enabling the API, choose your username at the top-right of the Meraki Dashboard and select **my profile**

4. Locate the section titled **Dashboard API access** and select **Generate new API key**

*Note: The API key is associated with a Dashboard administrator account. You can generate, revoke, and regenerate your API key on your profile.*

**Keep your API key safe as it provides authentication to all of your organizations with the API enabled. If your API key is shared, you can regenerate your API key at any time. This will revoke the existing API key.**

Copy and store your API key in a safe place. Dashboard does not store API keys in plaintext for security reasons, so this is the only time you will be able to record it. If you lose or forget your API key, you will have to revoke it and generate a new one.

Every request must specify an API key via a request header.

The API key must be specified in the URL header. The API will return a 404 (rather than a 403) in response to a request with a missing or incorrect API key in order to prevent leaking the existence of resources to unauthorized users.

## Versioning
Once an API version is released, we will make only backwards-compatible changes to it. Backwards-compatible changes include:

* Adding new API resources

* Adding new optional request parameters to existing API methods

* Adding new properties to existing API responses

* Changing the order of properties in existing API responses

## Rate Limit
* The Dashboard API is limited to **5 calls per second**, per organization.
* A burst of 5 additional calls are allowed in the first second, so a maximum of 15 calls in the first 2 seconds.
* The rate limiting technique is based off of the [token bucket model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Token_bucket).
* An error with a `429` status code will be returned when the rate limit has been exceeded.
* Expect to backoff for 1 - 2 seconds if the limit has been exceeded. You may have to wait potentially longer if a large number of requests were made within this timeframe.


## Additional Details
Identifiers in the API are opaque strings. A `{networkId}`, for example, might be the string "126043", whereas an `{orderId}` might contain characters, such as "4S1234567". Client applications must not try to parse them as numbers. Even identifiers that look like numbers might be too long to encode without loss of precision in Javascript, where the only numeric type is IEEE 754 floating point.

Verbs in the API follow the usual REST conventions:

`GET` returns the value of a resource or a list of resources, depending on whether an identifier is specified. For example, a `GET` of `/organizations` returns a list of organizations, whereas a `GET` of `/organizations/{organizationId}` returns a particular organization.

`POST` adds a new resource, as in a `POST` to `/organizations/{organizationId}/admins`, or performs some other non-idempotent change.

`PUT` updates a resource. `PUTs` are idempotent; they update a resource, creating it first if it does not already exist. A `PUT` should specify all the fields of a resource; the API will revert omitted fields to their default value.

`DELETE` removes a resource.

/**
 * Update an existing profile containing a Cisco Clarity payload
 * @method
 * @name MerakiDashboardApi#updateNetworkSmProfileClarity
 * @param {object} parameters - method options and parameters
     * @param {string} parameters.networkId - The Cisco Meraki Dashboard API is a modern REST API based on the [OpenAPI](https://swagger.io/docs/specification/about/) specification.

## What can the API be used for?
The Dashboard API can be used for many purposes. It's meant to be an open-ended tool. Here are some examples of use cases:

* Add new organizations, admins, networks, devices, VLANs, and more
* Configure networks at scale
* Automatically on-board and off-board new employees' teleworker setups
* Build your own dashboard for store managers, field techs, or unique use cases

## Enabling the Dashboard API
1. Begin by logging into [Meraki Dashboard](https://dashboard.meraki.com) and navigating to **Organization > Settings**

2. Locate the section titled **Dashboard API access** and select **Enable Access**, then **Save** your changes

3. After enabling the API, choose your username at the top-right of the Meraki Dashboard and select **my profile**

4. Locate the section titled **Dashboard API access** and select **Generate new API key**

*Note: The API key is associated with a Dashboard administrator account. You can generate, revoke, and regenerate your API key on your profile.*

**Keep your API key safe as it provides authentication to all of your organizations with the API enabled. If your API key is shared, you can regenerate your API key at any time. This will revoke the existing API key.**

Copy and store your API key in a safe place. Dashboard does not store API keys in plaintext for security reasons, so this is the only time you will be able to record it. If you lose or forget your API key, you will have to revoke it and generate a new one.

Every request must specify an API key via a request header.

The API key must be specified in the URL header. The API will return a 404 (rather than a 403) in response to a request with a missing or incorrect API key in order to prevent leaking the existence of resources to unauthorized users.

## Versioning
Once an API version is released, we will make only backwards-compatible changes to it. Backwards-compatible changes include:

* Adding new API resources

* Adding new optional request parameters to existing API methods

* Adding new properties to existing API responses

* Changing the order of properties in existing API responses

## Rate Limit
* The Dashboard API is limited to **5 calls per second**, per organization.
* A burst of 5 additional calls are allowed in the first second, so a maximum of 15 calls in the first 2 seconds.
* The rate limiting technique is based off of the [token bucket model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Token_bucket).
* An error with a `429` status code will be returned when the rate limit has been exceeded.
* Expect to backoff for 1 - 2 seconds if the limit has been exceeded. You may have to wait potentially longer if a large number of requests were made within this timeframe.


## Additional Details
Identifiers in the API are opaque strings. A `{networkId}`, for example, might be the string "126043", whereas an `{orderId}` might contain characters, such as "4S1234567". Client applications must not try to parse them as numbers. Even identifiers that look like numbers might be too long to encode without loss of precision in Javascript, where the only numeric type is IEEE 754 floating point.

Verbs in the API follow the usual REST conventions:

`GET` returns the value of a resource or a list of resources, depending on whether an identifier is specified. For example, a `GET` of `/organizations` returns a list of organizations, whereas a `GET` of `/organizations/{organizationId}` returns a particular organization.

`POST` adds a new resource, as in a `POST` to `/organizations/{organizationId}/admins`, or performs some other non-idempotent change.

`PUT` updates a resource. `PUTs` are idempotent; they update a resource, creating it first if it does not already exist. A `PUT` should specify all the fields of a resource; the API will revert omitted fields to their default value.

`DELETE` removes a resource.

Once an API version is released, we will make only backwards-compatible changes to it. Backwards-compatible changes include:

* Adding new API resources

* Adding new optional request parameters to existing API methods

* Adding new properties to existing API responses

* Changing the order of properties in existing API responses

## Rate Limit
* The Dashboard API is limited to **5 calls per second**, per organization.
* A burst of 5 additional calls are allowed in the first second, so a maximum of 15 calls in the first 2 seconds.
* The rate limiting technique is based off of the [token bucket model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Token_bucket).
* An error with a `429` status code will be returned when the rate limit has been exceeded.
* Expect to backoff for 1 - 2 seconds if the limit has been exceeded. You may have to wait potentially longer if a large number of requests were made within this timeframe.


## Additional Details
Identifiers in the API are opaque strings. A `{networkId}`, for example, might be the string "126043", whereas an `{orderId}` might contain characters, such as "4S1234567". Client applications must not try to parse them as numbers. Even identifiers that look like numbers might be too long to encode without loss of precision in Javascript, where the only numeric type is IEEE 754 floating point.

Verbs in the API follow the usual REST conventions:

`GET` returns the value of a resource or a list of resources, depending on whether an identifier is specified. For example, a `GET` of `/organizations` returns a list of organizations, whereas a `GET` of `/organizations/{organizationId}` returns a particular organization.

`POST` adds a new resource, as in a `POST` to `/organizations/{organizationId}/admins`, or performs some other non-idempotent change.

`PUT` updates a resource. `PUTs` are idempotent; they update a resource, creating it first if it does not already exist. A `PUT` should specify all the fields of a resource; the API will revert omitted fields to their default value.

`DELETE` removes a resource.

## What can the API be used for?
The Dashboard API can be used for many purposes. It's meant to be an open-ended tool. Here are some examples of use cases:

* Add new organizations, admins, networks, devices, VLANs, and more
* Configure networks at scale
* Automatically on-board and off-board new employees' teleworker setups
* Build your own dashboard for store managers, field techs, or unique use cases

## Enabling the Dashboard API
1. Begin by logging into [Meraki Dashboard](https://dashboard.meraki.com) and navigating to **Organization > Settings**

2. Locate the section titled **Dashboard API access** and select **Enable Access**, then **Save** your changes

3. After enabling the API, choose your username at the top-right of the Meraki Dashboard and select **my profile**

4. Locate the section titled **Dashboard API access** and select **Generate new API key**

*Note: The API key is associated with a Dashboard administrator account. You can generate, revoke, and regenerate your API key on your profile.*

**Keep your API key safe as it provides authentication to all of your organizations with the API enabled. If your API key is shared, you can regenerate your API key at any time. This will revoke the existing API key.**

Copy and store your API key in a safe place. Dashboard does not store API keys in plaintext for security reasons, so this is the only time you will be able to record it. If you lose or forget your API key, you will have to revoke it and generate a new one.

Every request must specify an API key via a request header.

The API key must be specified in the URL header. The API will return a 404 (rather than a 403) in response to a request with a missing or incorrect API key in order to prevent leaking the existence of resources to unauthorized users.

`GET` returns the value of a resource or a list of resources, depending on whether an identifier is specified. For example, a `GET` of `/organizations` returns a list of organizations, whereas a `GET` of `/organizations/{organizationId}` returns a particular organization.

`POST` adds a new resource, as in a `POST` to `/organizations/{organizationId}/admins`, or performs some other non-idempotent change.

`PUT` updates a resource. `PUTs` are idempotent; they update a resource, creating it first if it does not already exist. A `PUT` should specify all the fields of a resource; the API will revert omitted fields to their default value.

`DELETE` removes a resource.

     * @param {string} parameters.profileId - The Cisco Meraki Dashboard API is a modern REST API based on the [OpenAPI](https://swagger.io/docs/specification/about/) specification.

## What can the API be used for?
The Dashboard API can be used for many purposes. It's meant to be an open-ended tool. Here are some examples of use cases:

* Add new organizations, admins, networks, devices, VLANs, and more
* Configure networks at scale
* Automatically on-board and off-board new employees' teleworker setups
* Build your own dashboard for store managers, field techs, or unique use cases

## Enabling the Dashboard API
1. Begin by logging into [Meraki Dashboard](https://dashboard.meraki.com) and navigating to **Organization > Settings**

2. Locate the section titled **Dashboard API access** and select **Enable Access**, then **Save** your changes

3. After enabling the API, choose your username at the top-right of the Meraki Dashboard and select **my profile**

4. Locate the section titled **Dashboard API access** and select **Generate new API key**

*Note: The API key is associated with a Dashboard administrator account. You can generate, revoke, and regenerate your API key on your profile.*

**Keep your API key safe as it provides authentication to all of your organizations with the API enabled. If your API key is shared, you can regenerate your API key at any time. This will revoke the existing API key.**

Copy and store your API key in a safe place. Dashboard does not store API keys in plaintext for security reasons, so this is the only time you will be able to record it. If you lose or forget your API key, you will have to revoke it and generate a new one.

Every request must specify an API key via a request header.

The API key must be specified in the URL header. The API will return a 404 (rather than a 403) in response to a request with a missing or incorrect API key in order to prevent leaking the existence of resources to unauthorized users.

## Versioning
Once an API version is released, we will make only backwards-compatible changes to it. Backwards-compatible changes include:

* Adding new API resources

* Adding new optional request parameters to existing API methods

* Adding new properties to existing API responses

* Changing the order of properties in existing API responses

## Rate Limit
* The Dashboard API is limited to **5 calls per second**, per organization.
* A burst of 5 additional calls are allowed in the first second, so a maximum of 15 calls in the first 2 seconds.
* The rate limiting technique is based off of the [token bucket model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Token_bucket).
* An error with a `429` status code will be returned when the rate limit has been exceeded.
* Expect to backoff for 1 - 2 seconds if the limit has been exceeded. You may have to wait potentially longer if a large number of requests were made within this timeframe.


## Additional Details
Identifiers in the API are opaque strings. A `{networkId}`, for example, might be the string "126043", whereas an `{orderId}` might contain characters, such as "4S1234567". Client applications must not try to parse them as numbers. Even identifiers that look like numbers might be too long to encode without loss of precision in Javascript, where the only numeric type is IEEE 754 floating point.

## Versioning
Once an API version is released, we will make only backwards-compatible changes to it. Backwards-compatible changes include:

* Adding new API resources

* Adding new optional request parameters to existing API methods

* Adding new properties to existing API responses

* Changing the order of properties in existing API responses

## Rate Limit
* The Dashboard API is limited to **5 calls per second**, per organization.
* A burst of 5 additional calls are allowed in the first second, so a maximum of 15 calls in the first 2 seconds.
* The rate limiting technique is based off of the [token bucket model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Token_bucket).
* An error with a `429` status code will be returned when the rate limit has been exceeded.
* Expect to backoff for 1 - 2 seconds if the limit has been exceeded. You may have to wait potentially longer if a large number of requests were made within this timeframe.


## Additional Details
Identifiers in the API are opaque strings. A `{networkId}`, for example, might be the string "126043", whereas an `{orderId}` might contain characters, such as "4S1234567". Client applications must not try to parse them as numbers. Even identifiers that look like numbers might be too long to encode without loss of precision in Javascript, where the only numeric type is IEEE 754 floating point.

Verbs in the API follow the usual REST conventions:

`GET` returns the value of a resource or a list of resources, depending on whether an identifier is specified. For example, a `GET` of `/organizations` returns a list of organizations, whereas a `GET` of `/organizations/{organizationId}` returns a particular organization.

`POST` adds a new resource, as in a `POST` to `/organizations/{organizationId}/admins`, or performs some other non-idempotent change.

`PUT` updates a resource. `PUTs` are idempotent; they update a resource, creating it first if it does not already exist. A `PUT` should specify all the fields of a resource; the API will revert omitted fields to their default value.

`DELETE` removes a resource.

 * @param {object} parameters - method options and parameters
     * @param {string} parameters.networkId - The Cisco Meraki Dashboard API is a modern REST API based on the [OpenAPI](https://swagger.io/docs/specification/about/) specification.

## What can the API be used for?
The Dashboard API can be used for many purposes. It's meant to be an open-ended tool. Here are some examples of use cases:

* Add new organizations, admins, networks, devices, VLANs, and more
* Configure networks at scale
* Automatically on-board and off-board new employees' teleworker setups
* Build your own dashboard for store managers, field techs, or unique use cases

## Enabling the Dashboard API
1. Begin by logging into [Meraki Dashboard](https://dashboard.meraki.com) and navigating to **Organization > Settings**

2. Locate the section titled **Dashboard API access** and select **Enable Access**, then **Save** your changes

3. After enabling the API, choose your username at the top-right of the Meraki Dashboard and select **my profile**

4. Locate the section titled **Dashboard API access** and select **Generate new API key**

*Note: The API key is associated with a Dashboard administrator account. You can generate, revoke, and regenerate your API key on your profile.*

**Keep your API key safe as it provides authentication to all of your organizations with the API enabled. If your API key is shared, you can regenerate your API key at any time. This will revoke the existing API key.**

Copy and store your API key in a safe place. Dashboard does not store API keys in plaintext for security reasons, so this is the only time you will be able to record it. If you lose or forget your API key, you will have to revoke it and generate a new one.

Every request must specify an API key via a request header.

The API key must be specified in the URL header. The API will return a 404 (rather than a 403) in response to a request with a missing or incorrect API key in order to prevent leaking the existence of resources to unauthorized users.

The API key must be specified in the URL header. The API will return a 404 (rather than a 403) in response to a request with a missing or incorrect API key in order to prevent leaking the existence of resources to unauthorized users.

## Versioning
Once an API version is released, we will make only backwards-compatible changes to it. Backwards-compatible changes include:

* Adding new API resources

* Adding new optional request parameters to existing API methods

* Adding new properties to existing API responses

* Changing the order of properties in existing API responses

## Rate Limit
* The Dashboard API is limited to **5 calls per second**, per organization.
* A burst of 5 additional calls are allowed in the first second, so a maximum of 15 calls in the first 2 seconds.
* The rate limiting technique is based off of the [token bucket model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Token_bucket).
* An error with a `429` status code will be returned when the rate limit has been exceeded.
* Expect to backoff for 1 - 2 seconds if the limit has been exceeded. You may have to wait potentially longer if a large number of requests were made within this timeframe.


## Additional Details
Identifiers in the API are opaque strings. A `{networkId}`, for example, might be the string "126043", whereas an `{orderId}` might contain characters, such as "4S1234567". Client applications must not try to parse them as numbers. Even identifiers that look like numbers might be too long to encode without loss of precision in Javascript, where the only numeric type is IEEE 754 floating point.

Verbs in the API follow the usual REST conventions:

`GET` returns the value of a resource or a list of resources, depending on whether an identifier is specified. For example, a `GET` of `/organizations` returns a list of organizations, whereas a `GET` of `/organizations/{organizationId}` returns a particular organization.

`POST` adds a new resource, as in a `POST` to `/organizations/{organizationId}/admins`, or performs some other non-idempotent change.

`PUT` updates a resource. `PUTs` are idempotent; they update a resource, creating it first if it does not already exist. A `PUT` should specify all the fields of a resource; the API will revert omitted fields to their default value.

`DELETE` removes a resource.

## What can the API be used for?
The Dashboard API can be used for many purposes. It's meant to be an open-ended tool. Here are some examples of use cases:

* Add new organizations, admins, networks, devices, VLANs, and more
* Configure networks at scale
* Automatically on-board and off-board new employees' teleworker setups
* Build your own dashboard for store managers, field techs, or unique use cases

## Enabling the Dashboard API
1. Begin by logging into [Meraki Dashboard](https://dashboard.meraki.com) and navigating to **Organization > Settings**

2. Locate the section titled **Dashboard API access** and select **Enable Access**, then **Save** your changes

3. After enabling the API, choose your username at the top-right of the Meraki Dashboard and select **my profile**

4. Locate the section titled **Dashboard API access** and select **Generate new API key**

*Note: The API key is associated with a Dashboard administrator account. You can generate, revoke, and regenerate your API key on your profile.*

**Keep your API key safe as it provides authentication to all of your organizations with the API enabled. If your API key is shared, you can regenerate your API key at any time. This will revoke the existing API key.**

* A burst of 5 additional calls are allowed in the first second, so a maximum of 15 calls in the first 2 seconds.
* The rate limiting technique is based off of the [token bucket model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Token_bucket).
* An error with a `429` status code will be returned when the rate limit has been exceeded.
* Expect to backoff for 1 - 2 seconds if the limit has been exceeded. You may have to wait potentially longer if a large number of requests were made within this timeframe.


## Additional Details
Identifiers in the API are opaque strings. A `{networkId}`, for example, might be the string "126043", whereas an `{orderId}` might contain characters, such as "4S1234567". Client applications must not try to parse them as numbers. Even identifiers that look like numbers might be too long to encode without loss of precision in Javascript, where the only numeric type is IEEE 754 floating point.

Verbs in the API follow the usual REST conventions:

`GET` returns the value of a resource or a list of resources, depending on whether an identifier is specified. For example, a `GET` of `/organizations` returns a list of organizations, whereas a `GET` of `/organizations/{organizationId}` returns a particular organization.

`POST` adds a new resource, as in a `POST` to `/organizations/{organizationId}/admins`, or performs some other non-idempotent change.

`PUT` updates a resource. `PUTs` are idempotent; they update a resource, creating it first if it does not already exist. A `PUT` should specify all the fields of a resource; the API will revert omitted fields to their default value.

`DELETE` removes a resource.

## What can the API be used for?
The Dashboard API can be used for many purposes. It's meant to be an open-ended tool. Here are some examples of use cases:

* Add new organizations, admins, networks, devices, VLANs, and more
* Configure networks at scale
* Automatically on-board and off-board new employees' teleworker setups
* Build your own dashboard for store managers, field techs, or unique use cases

## Enabling the Dashboard API
1. Begin by logging into [Meraki Dashboard](https://dashboard.meraki.com) and navigating to **Organization > Settings**

2. Locate the section titled **Dashboard API access** and select **Enable Access**, then **Save** your changes

3. After enabling the API, choose your username at the top-right of the Meraki Dashboard and select **my profile**

4. Locate the section titled **Dashboard API access** and select **Generate new API key**

*Note: The API key is associated with a Dashboard administrator account. You can generate, revoke, and regenerate your API key on your profile.*

**Keep your API key safe as it provides authentication to all of your organizations with the API enabled. If your API key is shared, you can regenerate your API key at any time. This will revoke the existing API key.**

Copy and store your API key in a safe place. Dashboard does not store API keys in plaintext for security reasons, so this is the only time you will be able to record it. If you lose or forget your API key, you will have to revoke it and generate a new one.

Every request must specify an API key via a request header.

The API key must be specified in the URL header. The API will return a 404 (rather than a 403) in response to a request with a missing or incorrect API key in order to prevent leaking the existence of resources to unauthorized users.

## Versioning
Once an API version is released, we will make only backwards-compatible changes to it. Backwards-compatible changes include:

* Adding new API resources

* Adding new optional request parameters to existing API methods

* Adding new properties to existing API responses

* Changing the order of properties in existing API responses

/**
 * Return the client's daily cellular data usage history. Usage data is in kilobytes.
 * @method
 * @name MerakiDashboardApi#getNetworkSmCellularUsageHistory
 * @param {object} parameters - method options and parameters
     * @param {string} parameters.networkId - The Cisco Meraki Dashboard API is a modern REST API based on the [OpenAPI](https://swagger.io/docs/specification/about/) specification.

## What can the API be used for?
The Dashboard API can be used for many purposes. It's meant to be an open-ended tool. Here are some examples of use cases:

* Add new organizations, admins, networks, devices, VLANs, and more
* Configure networks at scale
* Automatically on-board and off-board new employees' teleworker setups
* Build your own dashboard for store managers, field techs, or unique use cases

## Enabling the Dashboard API
1. Begin by logging into [Meraki Dashboard](https://dashboard.meraki.com) and navigating to **Organization > Settings**

2. Locate the section titled **Dashboard API access** and select **Enable Access**, then **Save** your changes

3. After enabling the API, choose your username at the top-right of the Meraki Dashboard and select **my profile**

4. Locate the section titled **Dashboard API access** and select **Generate new API key**

*Note: The API key is associated with a Dashboard administrator account. You can generate, revoke, and regenerate your API key on your profile.*

**Keep your API key safe as it provides authentication to all of your organizations with the API enabled. If your API key is shared, you can regenerate your API key at any time. This will revoke the existing API key.**

Copy and store your API key in a safe place. Dashboard does not store API keys in plaintext for security reasons, so this is the only time you will be able to record it. If you lose or forget your API key, you will have to revoke it and generate a new one.

Every request must specify an API key via a request header.

The API key must be specified in the URL header. The API will return a 404 (rather than a 403) in response to a request with a missing or incorrect API key in order to prevent leaking the existence of resources to unauthorized users.

## Versioning
Once an API version is released, we will make only backwards-compatible changes to it. Backwards-compatible changes include:

* Adding new API resources

* Adding new optional request parameters to existing API methods

* Adding new properties to existing API responses

* Changing the order of properties in existing API responses

## Rate Limit
* The Dashboard API is limited to **5 calls per second**, per organization.
* A burst of 5 additional calls are allowed in the first second, so a maximum of 15 calls in the first 2 seconds.
* The rate limiting technique is based off of the [token bucket model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Token_bucket).
* An error with a `429` status code will be returned when the rate limit has been exceeded.
* Expect to backoff for 1 - 2 seconds if the limit has been exceeded. You may have to wait potentially longer if a large number of requests were made within this timeframe.


## Additional Details
Identifiers in the API are opaque strings. A `{networkId}`, for example, might be the string "126043", whereas an `{orderId}` might contain characters, such as "4S1234567". Client applications must not try to parse them as numbers. Even identifiers that look like numbers might be too long to encode without loss of precision in Javascript, where the only numeric type is IEEE 754 floating point.

Verbs in the API follow the usual REST conventions:

`GET` returns the value of a resource or a list of resources, depending on whether an identifier is specified. For example, a `GET` of `/organizations` returns a list of organizations, whereas a `GET` of `/organizations/{organizationId}` returns a particular organization.

`POST` adds a new resource, as in a `POST` to `/organizations/{organizationId}/admins`, or performs some other non-idempotent change.

`PUT` updates a resource. `PUTs` are idempotent; they update a resource, creating it first if it does not already exist. A `PUT` should specify all the fields of a resource; the API will revert omitted fields to their default value.

`DELETE` removes a resource.

/**
 * List the network adapters of a device
 * @method
 * @name MerakiDashboardApi#getNetworkSmNetworkAdapters
 * @param {object} parameters - method options and parameters
     * @param {string} parameters.networkId - The Cisco Meraki Dashboard API is a modern REST API based on the [OpenAPI](https://swagger.io/docs/specification/about/) specification.

## What can the API be used for?
The Dashboard API can be used for many purposes. It's meant to be an open-ended tool. Here are some examples of use cases:

* Add new organizations, admins, networks, devices, VLANs, and more
* Configure networks at scale
* Automatically on-board and off-board new employees' teleworker setups
* Build your own dashboard for store managers, field techs, or unique use cases

## Enabling the Dashboard API
1. Begin by logging into [Meraki Dashboard](https://dashboard.meraki.com) and navigating to **Organization > Settings**

2. Locate the section titled **Dashboard API access** and select **Enable Access**, then **Save** your changes

3. After enabling the API, choose your username at the top-right of the Meraki Dashboard and select **my profile**

4. Locate the section titled **Dashboard API access** and select **Generate new API key**

*Note: The API key is associated with a Dashboard administrator account. You can generate, revoke, and regenerate your API key on your profile.*

**Keep your API key safe as it provides authentication to all of your organizations with the API enabled. If your API key is shared, you can regenerate your API key at any time. This will revoke the existing API key.**

Copy and store your API key in a safe place. Dashboard does not store API keys in plaintext for security reasons, so this is the only time you will be able to record it. If you lose or forget your API key, you will have to revoke it and generate a new one.

Every request must specify an API key via a request header.

The API key must be specified in the URL header. The API will return a 404 (rather than a 403) in response to a request with a missing or incorrect API key in order to prevent leaking the existence of resources to unauthorized users.

## Versioning
Once an API version is released, we will make only backwards-compatible changes to it. Backwards-compatible changes include:

* Adding new API resources

* Adding new optional request parameters to existing API methods

* Adding new properties to existing API responses

* Changing the order of properties in existing API responses

## Rate Limit
* The Dashboard API is limited to **5 calls per second**, per organization.
* A burst of 5 additional calls are allowed in the first second, so a maximum of 15 calls in the first 2 seconds.
* The rate limiting technique is based off of the [token bucket model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Token_bucket).
* An error with a `429` status code will be returned when the rate limit has been exceeded.
* Expect to backoff for 1 - 2 seconds if the limit has been exceeded. You may have to wait potentially longer if a large number of requests were made within this timeframe.


## Additional Details
Identifiers in the API are opaque strings. A `{networkId}`, for example, might be the string "126043", whereas an `{orderId}` might contain characters, such as "4S1234567". Client applications must not try to parse them as numbers. Even identifiers that look like numbers might be too long to encode without loss of precision in Javascript, where the only numeric type is IEEE 754 floating point.

Verbs in the API follow the usual REST conventions:

`GET` returns the value of a resource or a list of resources, depending on whether an identifier is specified. For example, a `GET` of `/organizations` returns a list of organizations, whereas a `GET` of `/organizations/{organizationId}` returns a particular organization.

`POST` adds a new resource, as in a `POST` to `/organizations/{organizationId}/admins`, or performs some other non-idempotent change.

`PUT` updates a resource. `PUTs` are idempotent; they update a resource, creating it first if it does not already exist. A `PUT` should specify all the fields of a resource; the API will revert omitted fields to their default value.

`DELETE` removes a resource.

 * Get a list of softwares associated with a device
 * @method
 * @name MerakiDashboardApi#getNetworkSmSoftwares
 * @param {object} parameters - method options and parameters
     * @param {string} parameters.networkId - The Cisco Meraki Dashboard API is a modern REST API based on the [OpenAPI](https://swagger.io/docs/specification/about/) specification.

## What can the API be used for?
The Dashboard API can be used for many purposes. It's meant to be an open-ended tool. Here are some examples of use cases:

* Add new organizations, admins, networks, devices, VLANs, and more
* Configure networks at scale
* Automatically on-board and off-board new employees' teleworker setups
* Build your own dashboard for store managers, field techs, or unique use cases

## Enabling the Dashboard API
1. Begin by logging into [Meraki Dashboard](https://dashboard.meraki.com) and navigating to **Organization > Settings**

2. Locate the section titled **Dashboard API access** and select **Enable Access**, then **Save** your changes

3. After enabling the API, choose your username at the top-right of the Meraki Dashboard and select **my profile**

4. Locate the section titled **Dashboard API access** and select **Generate new API key**

*Note: The API key is associated with a Dashboard administrator account. You can generate, revoke, and regenerate your API key on your profile.*

**Keep your API key safe as it provides authentication to all of your organizations with the API enabled. If your API key is shared, you can regenerate your API key at any time. This will revoke the existing API key.**

Copy and store your API key in a safe place. Dashboard does not store API keys in plaintext for security reasons, so this is the only time you will be able to record it. If you lose or forget your API key, you will have to revoke it and generate a new one.

Every request must specify an API key via a request header.

The API key must be specified in the URL header. The API will return a 404 (rather than a 403) in response to a request with a missing or incorrect API key in order to prevent leaking the existence of resources to unauthorized users.

## Versioning
Once an API version is released, we will make only backwards-compatible changes to it. Backwards-compatible changes include:

* Adding new API resources

* Adding new optional request parameters to existing API methods

* Adding new properties to existing API responses

* Changing the order of properties in existing API responses

## Rate Limit
* The Dashboard API is limited to **5 calls per second**, per organization.
* A burst of 5 additional calls are allowed in the first second, so a maximum of 15 calls in the first 2 seconds.
* The rate limiting technique is based off of the [token bucket model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Token_bucket).
* An error with a `429` status code will be returned when the rate limit has been exceeded.
* Expect to backoff for 1 - 2 seconds if the limit has been exceeded. You may have to wait potentially longer if a large number of requests were made within this timeframe.


## Additional Details
Identifiers in the API are opaque strings. A `{networkId}`, for example, might be the string "126043", whereas an `{orderId}` might contain characters, such as "4S1234567". Client applications must not try to parse them as numbers. Even identifiers that look like numbers might be too long to encode without loss of precision in Javascript, where the only numeric type is IEEE 754 floating point.

Verbs in the API follow the usual REST conventions:

`GET` returns the value of a resource or a list of resources, depending on whether an identifier is specified. For example, a `GET` of `/organizations` returns a list of organizations, whereas a `GET` of `/organizations/{organizationId}` returns a particular organization.

`POST` adds a new resource, as in a `POST` to `/organizations/{organizationId}/admins`, or performs some other non-idempotent change.

`PUT` updates a resource. `PUTs` are idempotent; they update a resource, creating it first if it does not already exist. A `PUT` should specify all the fields of a resource; the API will revert omitted fields to their default value.

`DELETE` removes a resource.

* Adding new optional request parameters to existing API methods

* Adding new properties to existing API responses

* Changing the order of properties in existing API responses

## Rate Limit
* The Dashboard API is limited to **5 calls per second**, per organization.
* A burst of 5 additional calls are allowed in the first second, so a maximum of 15 calls in the first 2 seconds.
* The rate limiting technique is based off of the [token bucket model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Token_bucket).
* An error with a `429` status code will be returned when the rate limit has been exceeded.
* Expect to backoff for 1 - 2 seconds if the limit has been exceeded. You may have to wait potentially longer if a large number of requests were made within this timeframe.


## Additional Details
Identifiers in the API are opaque strings. A `{networkId}`, for example, might be the string "126043", whereas an `{orderId}` might contain characters, such as "4S1234567". Client applications must not try to parse them as numbers. Even identifiers that look like numbers might be too long to encode without loss of precision in Javascript, where the only numeric type is IEEE 754 floating point.

Verbs in the API follow the usual REST conventions:

`GET` returns the value of a resource or a list of resources, depending on whether an identifier is specified. For example, a `GET` of `/organizations` returns a list of organizations, whereas a `GET` of `/organizations/{organizationId}` returns a particular organization.

`POST` adds a new resource, as in a `POST` to `/organizations/{organizationId}/admins`, or performs some other non-idempotent change.

`PUT` updates a resource. `PUTs` are idempotent; they update a resource, creating it first if it does not already exist. A `PUT` should specify all the fields of a resource; the API will revert omitted fields to their default value.

`DELETE` removes a resource.

## What can the API be used for?
The Dashboard API can be used for many purposes. It's meant to be an open-ended tool. Here are some examples of use cases:

* Add new organizations, admins, networks, devices, VLANs, and more
* Configure networks at scale
* Automatically on-board and off-board new employees' teleworker setups
* Build your own dashboard for store managers, field techs, or unique use cases

## Enabling the Dashboard API
1. Begin by logging into [Meraki Dashboard](https://dashboard.meraki.com) and navigating to **Organization > Settings**

2. Locate the section titled **Dashboard API access** and select **Enable Access**, then **Save** your changes

3. After enabling the API, choose your username at the top-right of the Meraki Dashboard and select **my profile**

4. Locate the section titled **Dashboard API access** and select **Generate new API key**

*Note: The API key is associated with a Dashboard administrator account. You can generate, revoke, and regenerate your API key on your profile.*

**Keep your API key safe as it provides authentication to all of your organizations with the API enabled. If your API key is shared, you can regenerate your API key at any time. This will revoke the existing API key.**

Copy and store your API key in a safe place. Dashboard does not store API keys in plaintext for security reasons, so this is the only time you will be able to record it. If you lose or forget your API key, you will have to revoke it and generate a new one.

Every request must specify an API key via a request header.

The API key must be specified in the URL header. The API will return a 404 (rather than a 403) in response to a request with a missing or incorrect API key in order to prevent leaking the existence of resources to unauthorized users.

/**
 * Update the attributes of an SSID
 * @method
 * @name MerakiDashboardApi#updateNetworkSsid
 * @param {object} parameters - method options and parameters
     * @param {string} parameters.networkId - The Cisco Meraki Dashboard API is a modern REST API based on the [OpenAPI](https://swagger.io/docs/specification/about/) specification.

## What can the API be used for?
The Dashboard API can be used for many purposes. It's meant to be an open-ended tool. Here are some examples of use cases:

* Add new organizations, admins, networks, devices, VLANs, and more
* Configure networks at scale
* Automatically on-board and off-board new employees' teleworker setups
* Build your own dashboard for store managers, field techs, or unique use cases

## Enabling the Dashboard API
1. Begin by logging into [Meraki Dashboard](https://dashboard.meraki.com) and navigating to **Organization > Settings**

2. Locate the section titled **Dashboard API access** and select **Enable Access**, then **Save** your changes

3. After enabling the API, choose your username at the top-right of the Meraki Dashboard and select **my profile**

4. Locate the section titled **Dashboard API access** and select **Generate new API key**

*Note: The API key is associated with a Dashboard administrator account. You can generate, revoke, and regenerate your API key on your profile.*

**Keep your API key safe as it provides authentication to all of your organizations with the API enabled. If your API key is shared, you can regenerate your API key at any time. This will revoke the existing API key.**

Copy and store your API key in a safe place. Dashboard does not store API keys in plaintext for security reasons, so this is the only time you will be able to record it. If you lose or forget your API key, you will have to revoke it and generate a new one.

Every request must specify an API key via a request header.

The API key must be specified in the URL header. The API will return a 404 (rather than a 403) in response to a request with a missing or incorrect API key in order to prevent leaking the existence of resources to unauthorized users.

## Versioning
Once an API version is released, we will make only backwards-compatible changes to it. Backwards-compatible changes include:

* Adding new API resources

* Adding new optional request parameters to existing API methods

* Adding new properties to existing API responses

* Changing the order of properties in existing API responses

## Rate Limit
* The Dashboard API is limited to **5 calls per second**, per organization.
* A burst of 5 additional calls are allowed in the first second, so a maximum of 15 calls in the first 2 seconds.
* The rate limiting technique is based off of the [token bucket model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Token_bucket).
* An error with a `429` status code will be returned when the rate limit has been exceeded.
* Expect to backoff for 1 - 2 seconds if the limit has been exceeded. You may have to wait potentially longer if a large number of requests were made within this timeframe.


## Additional Details
Identifiers in the API are opaque strings. A `{networkId}`, for example, might be the string "126043", whereas an `{orderId}` might contain characters, such as "4S1234567". Client applications must not try to parse them as numbers. Even identifiers that look like numbers might be too long to encode without loss of precision in Javascript, where the only numeric type is IEEE 754 floating point.

Verbs in the API follow the usual REST conventions:

`GET` returns the value of a resource or a list of resources, depending on whether an identifier is specified. For example, a `GET` of `/organizations` returns a list of organizations, whereas a `GET` of `/organizations/{organizationId}` returns a particular organization.

`POST` adds a new resource, as in a `POST` to `/organizations/{organizationId}/admins`, or performs some other non-idempotent change.

`PUT` updates a resource. `PUTs` are idempotent; they update a resource, creating it first if it does not already exist. A `PUT` should specify all the fields of a resource; the API will revert omitted fields to their default value.

`DELETE` removes a resource.

Identifiers in the API are opaque strings. A `{networkId}`, for example, might be the string "126043", whereas an `{orderId}` might contain characters, such as "4S1234567". Client applications must not try to parse them as numbers. Even identifiers that look like numbers might be too long to encode without loss of precision in Javascript, where the only numeric type is IEEE 754 floating point.

Verbs in the API follow the usual REST conventions:

`GET` returns the value of a resource or a list of resources, depending on whether an identifier is specified. For example, a `GET` of `/organizations` returns a list of organizations, whereas a `GET` of `/organizations/{organizationId}` returns a particular organization.

`POST` adds a new resource, as in a `POST` to `/organizations/{organizationId}/admins`, or performs some other non-idempotent change.

`PUT` updates a resource. `PUTs` are idempotent; they update a resource, creating it first if it does not already exist. A `PUT` should specify all the fields of a resource; the API will revert omitted fields to their default value.

`DELETE` removes a resource.

## What can the API be used for?
The Dashboard API can be used for many purposes. It's meant to be an open-ended tool. Here are some examples of use cases:

* Add new organizations, admins, networks, devices, VLANs, and more
* Configure networks at scale
* Automatically on-board and off-board new employees' teleworker setups
* Build your own dashboard for store managers, field techs, or unique use cases

## Enabling the Dashboard API
1. Begin by logging into [Meraki Dashboard](https://dashboard.meraki.com) and navigating to **Organization > Settings**

2. Locate the section titled **Dashboard API access** and select **Enable Access**, then **Save** your changes

3. After enabling the API, choose your username at the top-right of the Meraki Dashboard and select **my profile**

4. Locate the section titled **Dashboard API access** and select **Generate new API key**

*Note: The API key is associated with a Dashboard administrator account. You can generate, revoke, and regenerate your API key on your profile.*

**Keep your API key safe as it provides authentication to all of your organizations with the API enabled. If your API key is shared, you can regenerate your API key at any time. This will revoke the existing API key.**

Copy and store your API key in a safe place. Dashboard does not store API keys in plaintext for security reasons, so this is the only time you will be able to record it. If you lose or forget your API key, you will have to revoke it and generate a new one.

Every request must specify an API key via a request header.

The API key must be specified in the URL header. The API will return a 404 (rather than a 403) in response to a request with a missing or incorrect API key in order to prevent leaking the existence of resources to unauthorized users.

## Versioning
Once an API version is released, we will make only backwards-compatible changes to it. Backwards-compatible changes include:

* Adding new API resources

* Adding new optional request parameters to existing API methods

* Adding new properties to existing API responses

* Changing the order of properties in existing API responses

## Rate Limit
* The Dashboard API is limited to **5 calls per second**, per organization.
* A burst of 5 additional calls are allowed in the first second, so a maximum of 15 calls in the first 2 seconds.
* The rate limiting technique is based off of the [token bucket model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Token_bucket).
* An error with a `429` status code will be returned when the rate limit has been exceeded.
* Expect to backoff for 1 - 2 seconds if the limit has been exceeded. You may have to wait potentially longer if a large number of requests were made within this timeframe.

/**
 * Update the traffic shaping settings for an SSID on an MR network
 * @method
 * @name MerakiDashboardApi#updateNetworkSsidTrafficShaping
 * @param {object} parameters - method options and parameters
     * @param {string} parameters.networkId - The Cisco Meraki Dashboard API is a modern REST API based on the [OpenAPI](https://swagger.io/docs/specification/about/) specification.

## What can the API be used for?
The Dashboard API can be used for many purposes. It's meant to be an open-ended tool. Here are some examples of use cases:

* Add new organizations, admins, networks, devices, VLANs, and more
* Configure networks at scale
* Automatically on-board and off-board new employees' teleworker setups
* Build your own dashboard for store managers, field techs, or unique use cases

## Enabling the Dashboard API
1. Begin by logging into [Meraki Dashboard](https://dashboard.meraki.com) and navigating to **Organization > Settings**

2. Locate the section titled **Dashboard API access** and select **Enable Access**, then **Save** your changes

3. After enabling the API, choose your username at the top-right of the Meraki Dashboard and select **my profile**

4. Locate the section titled **Dashboard API access** and select **Generate new API key**

*Note: The API key is associated with a Dashboard administrator account. You can generate, revoke, and regenerate your API key on your profile.*

**Keep your API key safe as it provides authentication to all of your organizations with the API enabled. If your API key is shared, you can regenerate your API key at any time. This will revoke the existing API key.**

Copy and store your API key in a safe place. Dashboard does not store API keys in plaintext for security reasons, so this is the only time you will be able to record it. If you lose or forget your API key, you will have to revoke it and generate a new one.

Every request must specify an API key via a request header.

The API key must be specified in the URL header. The API will return a 404 (rather than a 403) in response to a request with a missing or incorrect API key in order to prevent leaking the existence of resources to unauthorized users.

## Versioning
Once an API version is released, we will make only backwards-compatible changes to it. Backwards-compatible changes include:

* Adding new API resources

* Adding new optional request parameters to existing API methods

* Adding new properties to existing API responses

* Changing the order of properties in existing API responses

## Rate Limit
* The Dashboard API is limited to **5 calls per second**, per organization.
* A burst of 5 additional calls are allowed in the first second, so a maximum of 15 calls in the first 2 seconds.
* The rate limiting technique is based off of the [token bucket model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Token_bucket).
* An error with a `429` status code will be returned when the rate limit has been exceeded.
* Expect to backoff for 1 - 2 seconds if the limit has been exceeded. You may have to wait potentially longer if a large number of requests were made within this timeframe.


## Additional Details
Identifiers in the API are opaque strings. A `{networkId}`, for example, might be the string "126043", whereas an `{orderId}` might contain characters, such as "4S1234567". Client applications must not try to parse them as numbers. Even identifiers that look like numbers might be too long to encode without loss of precision in Javascript, where the only numeric type is IEEE 754 floating point.

Verbs in the API follow the usual REST conventions:

`GET` returns the value of a resource or a list of resources, depending on whether an identifier is specified. For example, a `GET` of `/organizations` returns a list of organizations, whereas a `GET` of `/organizations/{organizationId}` returns a particular organization.

`POST` adds a new resource, as in a `POST` to `/organizations/{organizationId}/admins`, or performs some other non-idempotent change.

`PUT` updates a resource. `PUTs` are idempotent; they update a resource, creating it first if it does not already exist. A `PUT` should specify all the fields of a resource; the API will revert omitted fields to their default value.

`DELETE` removes a resource.

Copy and store your API key in a safe place. Dashboard does not store API keys in plaintext for security reasons, so this is the only time you will be able to record it. If you lose or forget your API key, you will have to revoke it and generate a new one.

Every request must specify an API key via a request header.

The API key must be specified in the URL header. The API will return a 404 (rather than a 403) in response to a request with a missing or incorrect API key in order to prevent leaking the existence of resources to unauthorized users.

## Versioning
Once an API version is released, we will make only backwards-compatible changes to it. Backwards-compatible changes include:

* Adding new API resources

* Adding new optional request parameters to existing API methods

* Adding new properties to existing API responses

* Changing the order of properties in existing API responses

## Rate Limit
* The Dashboard API is limited to **5 calls per second**, per organization.
* A burst of 5 additional calls are allowed in the first second, so a maximum of 15 calls in the first 2 seconds.
* The rate limiting technique is based off of the [token bucket model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Token_bucket).
* An error with a `429` status code will be returned when the rate limit has been exceeded.
* Expect to backoff for 1 - 2 seconds if the limit has been exceeded. You may have to wait potentially longer if a large number of requests were made within this timeframe.


## Additional Details
Identifiers in the API are opaque strings. A `{networkId}`, for example, might be the string "126043", whereas an `{orderId}` might contain characters, such as "4S1234567". Client applications must not try to parse them as numbers. Even identifiers that look like numbers might be too long to encode without loss of precision in Javascript, where the only numeric type is IEEE 754 floating point.

Verbs in the API follow the usual REST conventions:

`GET` returns the value of a resource or a list of resources, depending on whether an identifier is specified. For example, a `GET` of `/organizations` returns a list of organizations, whereas a `GET` of `/organizations/{organizationId}` returns a particular organization.

`POST` adds a new resource, as in a `POST` to `/organizations/{organizationId}/admins`, or performs some other non-idempotent change.

`PUT` updates a resource. `PUTs` are idempotent; they update a resource, creating it first if it does not already exist. A `PUT` should specify all the fields of a resource; the API will revert omitted fields to their default value.

`DELETE` removes a resource.

## What can the API be used for?
The Dashboard API can be used for many purposes. It's meant to be an open-ended tool. Here are some examples of use cases:

* Add new organizations, admins, networks, devices, VLANs, and more
* Configure networks at scale
* Automatically on-board and off-board new employees' teleworker setups
* Build your own dashboard for store managers, field techs, or unique use cases

## Enabling the Dashboard API
1. Begin by logging into [Meraki Dashboard](https://dashboard.meraki.com) and navigating to **Organization > Settings**

2. Locate the section titled **Dashboard API access** and select **Enable Access**, then **Save** your changes

3. After enabling the API, choose your username at the top-right of the Meraki Dashboard and select **my profile**

4. Locate the section titled **Dashboard API access** and select **Generate new API key**

*Note: The API key is associated with a Dashboard administrator account. You can generate, revoke, and regenerate your API key on your profile.*

/**
 * Delete a static route from an MX or teleworker network
 * @method
 * @name MerakiDashboardApi#deleteNetworkStaticRoute
 * @param {object} parameters - method options and parameters
     * @param {string} parameters.networkId - The Cisco Meraki Dashboard API is a modern REST API based on the [OpenAPI](https://swagger.io/docs/specification/about/) specification.

## What can the API be used for?
The Dashboard API can be used for many purposes. It's meant to be an open-ended tool. Here are some examples of use cases:

* Add new organizations, admins, networks, devices, VLANs, and more
* Configure networks at scale
* Automatically on-board and off-board new employees' teleworker setups
* Build your own dashboard for store managers, field techs, or unique use cases

## Enabling the Dashboard API
1. Begin by logging into [Meraki Dashboard](https://dashboard.meraki.com) and navigating to **Organization > Settings**

2. Locate the section titled **Dashboard API access** and select **Enable Access**, then **Save** your changes

3. After enabling the API, choose your username at the top-right of the Meraki Dashboard and select **my profile**

4. Locate the section titled **Dashboard API access** and select **Generate new API key**

*Note: The API key is associated with a Dashboard administrator account. You can generate, revoke, and regenerate your API key on your profile.*

**Keep your API key safe as it provides authentication to all of your organizations with the API enabled. If your API key is shared, you can regenerate your API key at any time. This will revoke the existing API key.**

Copy and store your API key in a safe place. Dashboard does not store API keys in plaintext for security reasons, so this is the only time you will be able to record it. If you lose or forget your API key, you will have to revoke it and generate a new one.

Every request must specify an API key via a request header.

The API key must be specified in the URL header. The API will return a 404 (rather than a 403) in response to a request with a missing or incorrect API key in order to prevent leaking the existence of resources to unauthorized users.

## Versioning
Once an API version is released, we will make only backwards-compatible changes to it. Backwards-compatible changes include:

* Adding new API resources

* Adding new optional request parameters to existing API methods

* Adding new properties to existing API responses

* Changing the order of properties in existing API responses

## Rate Limit
* The Dashboard API is limited to **5 calls per second**, per organization.
* A burst of 5 additional calls are allowed in the first second, so a maximum of 15 calls in the first 2 seconds.
* The rate limiting technique is based off of the [token bucket model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Token_bucket).
* An error with a `429` status code will be returned when the rate limit has been exceeded.
* Expect to backoff for 1 - 2 seconds if the limit has been exceeded. You may have to wait potentially longer if a large number of requests were made within this timeframe.


## Additional Details
Identifiers in the API are opaque strings. A `{networkId}`, for example, might be the string "126043", whereas an `{orderId}` might contain characters, such as "4S1234567". Client applications must not try to parse them as numbers. Even identifiers that look like numbers might be too long to encode without loss of precision in Javascript, where the only numeric type is IEEE 754 floating point.

Verbs in the API follow the usual REST conventions:

`GET` returns the value of a resource or a list of resources, depending on whether an identifier is specified. For example, a `GET` of `/organizations` returns a list of organizations, whereas a `GET` of `/organizations/{organizationId}` returns a particular organization.

`POST` adds a new resource, as in a `POST` to `/organizations/{organizationId}/admins`, or performs some other non-idempotent change.

`PUT` updates a resource. `PUTs` are idempotent; they update a resource, creating it first if it does not already exist. A `PUT` should specify all the fields of a resource; the API will revert omitted fields to their default value.

`DELETE` removes a resource.

/**
 * Delete a switch port schedule
 * @method
 * @name MerakiDashboardApi#deleteNetworkSwitchPortSchedule
 * @param {object} parameters - method options and parameters
     * @param {string} parameters.networkId - The Cisco Meraki Dashboard API is a modern REST API based on the [OpenAPI](https://swagger.io/docs/specification/about/) specification.

## What can the API be used for?
The Dashboard API can be used for many purposes. It's meant to be an open-ended tool. Here are some examples of use cases:

* Add new organizations, admins, networks, devices, VLANs, and more
* Configure networks at scale
* Automatically on-board and off-board new employees' teleworker setups
* Build your own dashboard for store managers, field techs, or unique use cases

## Enabling the Dashboard API
1. Begin by logging into [Meraki Dashboard](https://dashboard.meraki.com) and navigating to **Organization > Settings**

2. Locate the section titled **Dashboard API access** and select **Enable Access**, then **Save** your changes

3. After enabling the API, choose your username at the top-right of the Meraki Dashboard and select **my profile**

4. Locate the section titled **Dashboard API access** and select **Generate new API key**

*Note: The API key is associated with a Dashboard administrator account. You can generate, revoke, and regenerate your API key on your profile.*

**Keep your API key safe as it provides authentication to all of your organizations with the API enabled. If your API key is shared, you can regenerate your API key at any time. This will revoke the existing API key.**

Copy and store your API key in a safe place. Dashboard does not store API keys in plaintext for security reasons, so this is the only time you will be able to record it. If you lose or forget your API key, you will have to revoke it and generate a new one.

Every request must specify an API key via a request header.

The API key must be specified in the URL header. The API will return a 404 (rather than a 403) in response to a request with a missing or incorrect API key in order to prevent leaking the existence of resources to unauthorized users.

## Versioning
Once an API version is released, we will make only backwards-compatible changes to it. Backwards-compatible changes include:

* Adding new API resources

* Adding new optional request parameters to existing API methods

* Adding new properties to existing API responses

* Changing the order of properties in existing API responses

## Rate Limit
* The Dashboard API is limited to **5 calls per second**, per organization.
* A burst of 5 additional calls are allowed in the first second, so a maximum of 15 calls in the first 2 seconds.
* The rate limiting technique is based off of the [token bucket model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Token_bucket).
* An error with a `429` status code will be returned when the rate limit has been exceeded.
* Expect to backoff for 1 - 2 seconds if the limit has been exceeded. You may have to wait potentially longer if a large number of requests were made within this timeframe.


## Additional Details
Identifiers in the API are opaque strings. A `{networkId}`, for example, might be the string "126043", whereas an `{orderId}` might contain characters, such as "4S1234567". Client applications must not try to parse them as numbers. Even identifiers that look like numbers might be too long to encode without loss of precision in Javascript, where the only numeric type is IEEE 754 floating point.

Verbs in the API follow the usual REST conventions:

`GET` returns the value of a resource or a list of resources, depending on whether an identifier is specified. For example, a `GET` of `/organizations` returns a list of organizations, whereas a `GET` of `/organizations/{organizationId}` returns a particular organization.

`POST` adds a new resource, as in a `POST` to `/organizations/{organizationId}/admins`, or performs some other non-idempotent change.

`PUT` updates a resource. `PUTs` are idempotent; they update a resource, creating it first if it does not already exist. A `PUT` should specify all the fields of a resource; the API will revert omitted fields to their default value.

`DELETE` removes a resource.

3. After enabling the API, choose your username at the top-right of the Meraki Dashboard and select **my profile**

4. Locate the section titled **Dashboard API access** and select **Generate new API key**

*Note: The API key is associated with a Dashboard administrator account. You can generate, revoke, and regenerate your API key on your profile.*

**Keep your API key safe as it provides authentication to all of your organizations with the API enabled. If your API key is shared, you can regenerate your API key at any time. This will revoke the existing API key.**

Copy and store your API key in a safe place. Dashboard does not store API keys in plaintext for security reasons, so this is the only time you will be able to record it. If you lose or forget your API key, you will have to revoke it and generate a new one.

Every request must specify an API key via a request header.

The API key must be specified in the URL header. The API will return a 404 (rather than a 403) in response to a request with a missing or incorrect API key in order to prevent leaking the existence of resources to unauthorized users.

## Versioning
Once an API version is released, we will make only backwards-compatible changes to it. Backwards-compatible changes include:

* Adding new API resources

* Adding new optional request parameters to existing API methods

* Adding new properties to existing API responses

* Changing the order of properties in existing API responses

## Rate Limit
* The Dashboard API is limited to **5 calls per second**, per organization.
* A burst of 5 additional calls are allowed in the first second, so a maximum of 15 calls in the first 2 seconds.
* The rate limiting technique is based off of the [token bucket model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Token_bucket).
* An error with a `429` status code will be returned when the rate limit has been exceeded.
* Expect to backoff for 1 - 2 seconds if the limit has been exceeded. You may have to wait potentially longer if a large number of requests were made within this timeframe.


## Additional Details
Identifiers in the API are opaque strings. A `{networkId}`, for example, might be the string "126043", whereas an `{orderId}` might contain characters, such as "4S1234567". Client applications must not try to parse them as numbers. Even identifiers that look like numbers might be too long to encode without loss of precision in Javascript, where the only numeric type is IEEE 754 floating point.

Verbs in the API follow the usual REST conventions:

`GET` returns the value of a resource or a list of resources, depending on whether an identifier is specified. For example, a `GET` of `/organizations` returns a list of organizations, whereas a `GET` of `/organizations/{organizationId}` returns a particular organization.

`POST` adds a new resource, as in a `POST` to `/organizations/{organizationId}/admins`, or performs some other non-idempotent change.

`PUT` updates a resource. `PUTs` are idempotent; they update a resource, creating it first if it does not already exist. A `PUT` should specify all the fields of a resource; the API will revert omitted fields to their default value.

`DELETE` removes a resource.

## What can the API be used for?
The Dashboard API can be used for many purposes. It's meant to be an open-ended tool. Here are some examples of use cases:

* Add new organizations, admins, networks, devices, VLANs, and more
* Configure networks at scale
* Automatically on-board and off-board new employees' teleworker setups
* Build your own dashboard for store managers, field techs, or unique use cases

The API key must be specified in the URL header. The API will return a 404 (rather than a 403) in response to a request with a missing or incorrect API key in order to prevent leaking the existence of resources to unauthorized users.

## Versioning
Once an API version is released, we will make only backwards-compatible changes to it. Backwards-compatible changes include:

* Adding new API resources

* Adding new optional request parameters to existing API methods

* Adding new properties to existing API responses

* Changing the order of properties in existing API responses

## Rate Limit
* The Dashboard API is limited to **5 calls per second**, per organization.
* A burst of 5 additional calls are allowed in the first second, so a maximum of 15 calls in the first 2 seconds.
* The rate limiting technique is based off of the [token bucket model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Token_bucket).
* An error with a `429` status code will be returned when the rate limit has been exceeded.
* Expect to backoff for 1 - 2 seconds if the limit has been exceeded. You may have to wait potentially longer if a large number of requests were made within this timeframe.


## Additional Details
Identifiers in the API are opaque strings. A `{networkId}`, for example, might be the string "126043", whereas an `{orderId}` might contain characters, such as "4S1234567". Client applications must not try to parse them as numbers. Even identifiers that look like numbers might be too long to encode without loss of precision in Javascript, where the only numeric type is IEEE 754 floating point.

Verbs in the API follow the usual REST conventions:

`GET` returns the value of a resource or a list of resources, depending on whether an identifier is specified. For example, a `GET` of `/organizations` returns a list of organizations, whereas a `GET` of `/organizations/{organizationId}` returns a particular organization.

`POST` adds a new resource, as in a `POST` to `/organizations/{organizationId}/admins`, or performs some other non-idempotent change.

`PUT` updates a resource. `PUTs` are idempotent; they update a resource, creating it first if it does not already exist. A `PUT` should specify all the fields of a resource; the API will revert omitted fields to their default value.

`DELETE` removes a resource.

## What can the API be used for?
The Dashboard API can be used for many purposes. It's meant to be an open-ended tool. Here are some examples of use cases:

* Add new organizations, admins, networks, devices, VLANs, and more
* Configure networks at scale
* Automatically on-board and off-board new employees' teleworker setups
* Build your own dashboard for store managers, field techs, or unique use cases

## Enabling the Dashboard API
1. Begin by logging into [Meraki Dashboard](https://dashboard.meraki.com) and navigating to **Organization > Settings**

2. Locate the section titled **Dashboard API access** and select **Enable Access**, then **Save** your changes

3. After enabling the API, choose your username at the top-right of the Meraki Dashboard and select **my profile**

4. Locate the section titled **Dashboard API access** and select **Generate new API key**

*Note: The API key is associated with a Dashboard administrator account. You can generate, revoke, and regenerate your API key on your profile.*

**Keep your API key safe as it provides authentication to all of your organizations with the API enabled. If your API key is shared, you can regenerate your API key at any time. This will revoke the existing API key.**

Identifiers in the API are opaque strings. A `{networkId}`, for example, might be the string "126043", whereas an `{orderId}` might contain characters, such as "4S1234567". Client applications must not try to parse them as numbers. Even identifiers that look like numbers might be too long to encode without loss of precision in Javascript, where the only numeric type is IEEE 754 floating point.

Verbs in the API follow the usual REST conventions:

`GET` returns the value of a resource or a list of resources, depending on whether an identifier is specified. For example, a `GET` of `/organizations` returns a list of organizations, whereas a `GET` of `/organizations/{organizationId}` returns a particular organization.

`POST` adds a new resource, as in a `POST` to `/organizations/{organizationId}/admins`, or performs some other non-idempotent change.

`PUT` updates a resource. `PUTs` are idempotent; they update a resource, creating it first if it does not already exist. A `PUT` should specify all the fields of a resource; the API will revert omitted fields to their default value.

`DELETE` removes a resource.

/**
 * Delete a quality of service rule
 * @method
 * @name MerakiDashboardApi#deleteNetworkSwitchSettingsQosRule
 * @param {object} parameters - method options and parameters
     * @param {string} parameters.networkId - The Cisco Meraki Dashboard API is a modern REST API based on the [OpenAPI](https://swagger.io/docs/specification/about/) specification.

## What can the API be used for?
The Dashboard API can be used for many purposes. It's meant to be an open-ended tool. Here are some examples of use cases:

* Add new organizations, admins, networks, devices, VLANs, and more
* Configure networks at scale
* Automatically on-board and off-board new employees' teleworker setups
* Build your own dashboard for store managers, field techs, or unique use cases

## Enabling the Dashboard API
1. Begin by logging into [Meraki Dashboard](https://dashboard.meraki.com) and navigating to **Organization > Settings**

2. Locate the section titled **Dashboard API access** and select **Enable Access**, then **Save** your changes

3. After enabling the API, choose your username at the top-right of the Meraki Dashboard and select **my profile**

4. Locate the section titled **Dashboard API access** and select **Generate new API key**

*Note: The API key is associated with a Dashboard administrator account. You can generate, revoke, and regenerate your API key on your profile.*

**Keep your API key safe as it provides authentication to all of your organizations with the API enabled. If your API key is shared, you can regenerate your API key at any time. This will revoke the existing API key.**

Copy and store your API key in a safe place. Dashboard does not store API keys in plaintext for security reasons, so this is the only time you will be able to record it. If you lose or forget your API key, you will have to revoke it and generate a new one.

Every request must specify an API key via a request header.

The API key must be specified in the URL header. The API will return a 404 (rather than a 403) in response to a request with a missing or incorrect API key in order to prevent leaking the existence of resources to unauthorized users.

## Versioning
Once an API version is released, we will make only backwards-compatible changes to it. Backwards-compatible changes include:

* Adding new API resources

* Adding new optional request parameters to existing API methods

* Adding new properties to existing API responses

* Changing the order of properties in existing API responses

## Rate Limit
* The Dashboard API is limited to **5 calls per second**, per organization.
* A burst of 5 additional calls are allowed in the first second, so a maximum of 15 calls in the first 2 seconds.
* The rate limiting technique is based off of the [token bucket model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Token_bucket).
* An error with a `429` status code will be returned when the rate limit has been exceeded.
* Expect to backoff for 1 - 2 seconds if the limit has been exceeded. You may have to wait potentially longer if a large number of requests were made within this timeframe.

/**
 * Update the global enhanced storm control configuration
 * @method
 * @name MerakiDashboardApi#updateNetworkSwitchSettingsStormControl
 * @param {object} parameters - method options and parameters
     * @param {string} parameters.networkId - The Cisco Meraki Dashboard API is a modern REST API based on the [OpenAPI](https://swagger.io/docs/specification/about/) specification.

## What can the API be used for?
The Dashboard API can be used for many purposes. It's meant to be an open-ended tool. Here are some examples of use cases:

* Add new organizations, admins, networks, devices, VLANs, and more
* Configure networks at scale
* Automatically on-board and off-board new employees' teleworker setups
* Build your own dashboard for store managers, field techs, or unique use cases

## Enabling the Dashboard API
1. Begin by logging into [Meraki Dashboard](https://dashboard.meraki.com) and navigating to **Organization > Settings**

2. Locate the section titled **Dashboard API access** and select **Enable Access**, then **Save** your changes

3. After enabling the API, choose your username at the top-right of the Meraki Dashboard and select **my profile**

4. Locate the section titled **Dashboard API access** and select **Generate new API key**

*Note: The API key is associated with a Dashboard administrator account. You can generate, revoke, and regenerate your API key on your profile.*

**Keep your API key safe as it provides authentication to all of your organizations with the API enabled. If your API key is shared, you can regenerate your API key at any time. This will revoke the existing API key.**

Copy and store your API key in a safe place. Dashboard does not store API keys in plaintext for security reasons, so this is the only time you will be able to record it. If you lose or forget your API key, you will have to revoke it and generate a new one.

Every request must specify an API key via a request header.

The API key must be specified in the URL header. The API will return a 404 (rather than a 403) in response to a request with a missing or incorrect API key in order to prevent leaking the existence of resources to unauthorized users.

## Versioning
Once an API version is released, we will make only backwards-compatible changes to it. Backwards-compatible changes include:

* Adding new API resources

* Adding new optional request parameters to existing API methods

* Adding new properties to existing API responses

* Changing the order of properties in existing API responses

## Rate Limit
* The Dashboard API is limited to **5 calls per second**, per organization.
* A burst of 5 additional calls are allowed in the first second, so a maximum of 15 calls in the first 2 seconds.
* The rate limiting technique is based off of the [token bucket model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Token_bucket).
* An error with a `429` status code will be returned when the rate limit has been exceeded.
* Expect to backoff for 1 - 2 seconds if the limit has been exceeded. You may have to wait potentially longer if a large number of requests were made within this timeframe.


## Additional Details
Identifiers in the API are opaque strings. A `{networkId}`, for example, might be the string "126043", whereas an `{orderId}` might contain characters, such as "4S1234567". Client applications must not try to parse them as numbers. Even identifiers that look like numbers might be too long to encode without loss of precision in Javascript, where the only numeric type is IEEE 754 floating point.

Verbs in the API follow the usual REST conventions:

`GET` returns the value of a resource or a list of resources, depending on whether an identifier is specified. For example, a `GET` of `/organizations` returns a list of organizations, whereas a `GET` of `/organizations/{organizationId}` returns a particular organization.

`POST` adds a new resource, as in a `POST` to `/organizations/{organizationId}/admins`, or performs some other non-idempotent change.

`PUT` updates a resource. `PUTs` are idempotent; they update a resource, creating it first if it does not already exist. A `PUT` should specify all the fields of a resource; the API will revert omitted fields to their default value.

`DELETE` removes a resource.

/**
 * Create a stack
 * @method
 * @name MerakiDashboardApi#createNetworkSwitchStack
 * @param {object} parameters - method options and parameters
     * @param {string} parameters.networkId - The Cisco Meraki Dashboard API is a modern REST API based on the [OpenAPI](https://swagger.io/docs/specification/about/) specification.

## What can the API be used for?
The Dashboard API can be used for many purposes. It's meant to be an open-ended tool. Here are some examples of use cases:

* Add new organizations, admins, networks, devices, VLANs, and more
* Configure networks at scale
* Automatically on-board and off-board new employees' teleworker setups
* Build your own dashboard for store managers, field techs, or unique use cases

## Enabling the Dashboard API
1. Begin by logging into [Meraki Dashboard](https://dashboard.meraki.com) and navigating to **Organization > Settings**

2. Locate the section titled **Dashboard API access** and select **Enable Access**, then **Save** your changes

3. After enabling the API, choose your username at the top-right of the Meraki Dashboard and select **my profile**

4. Locate the section titled **Dashboard API access** and select **Generate new API key**

*Note: The API key is associated with a Dashboard administrator account. You can generate, revoke, and regenerate your API key on your profile.*

**Keep your API key safe as it provides authentication to all of your organizations with the API enabled. If your API key is shared, you can regenerate your API key at any time. This will revoke the existing API key.**

Copy and store your API key in a safe place. Dashboard does not store API keys in plaintext for security reasons, so this is the only time you will be able to record it. If you lose or forget your API key, you will have to revoke it and generate a new one.

Every request must specify an API key via a request header.

The API key must be specified in the URL header. The API will return a 404 (rather than a 403) in response to a request with a missing or incorrect API key in order to prevent leaking the existence of resources to unauthorized users.

## Versioning
Once an API version is released, we will make only backwards-compatible changes to it. Backwards-compatible changes include:

* Adding new API resources

* Adding new optional request parameters to existing API methods

* Adding new properties to existing API responses

* Changing the order of properties in existing API responses

## Rate Limit
* The Dashboard API is limited to **5 calls per second**, per organization.
* A burst of 5 additional calls are allowed in the first second, so a maximum of 15 calls in the first 2 seconds.
* The rate limiting technique is based off of the [token bucket model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Token_bucket).
* An error with a `429` status code will be returned when the rate limit has been exceeded.
* Expect to backoff for 1 - 2 seconds if the limit has been exceeded. You may have to wait potentially longer if a large number of requests were made within this timeframe.


## Additional Details
Identifiers in the API are opaque strings. A `{networkId}`, for example, might be the string "126043", whereas an `{orderId}` might contain characters, such as "4S1234567". Client applications must not try to parse them as numbers. Even identifiers that look like numbers might be too long to encode without loss of precision in Javascript, where the only numeric type is IEEE 754 floating point.

Verbs in the API follow the usual REST conventions:

`GET` returns the value of a resource or a list of resources, depending on whether an identifier is specified. For example, a `GET` of `/organizations` returns a list of organizations, whereas a `GET` of `/organizations/{organizationId}` returns a particular organization.

`POST` adds a new resource, as in a `POST` to `/organizations/{organizationId}/admins`, or performs some other non-idempotent change.

`PUT` updates a resource. `PUTs` are idempotent; they update a resource, creating it first if it does not already exist. A `PUT` should specify all the fields of a resource; the API will revert omitted fields to their default value.

`DELETE` removes a resource.

3. After enabling the API, choose your username at the top-right of the Meraki Dashboard and select **my profile**

4. Locate the section titled **Dashboard API access** and select **Generate new API key**

*Note: The API key is associated with a Dashboard administrator account. You can generate, revoke, and regenerate your API key on your profile.*

**Keep your API key safe as it provides authentication to all of your organizations with the API enabled. If your API key is shared, you can regenerate your API key at any time. This will revoke the existing API key.**

Copy and store your API key in a safe place. Dashboard does not store API keys in plaintext for security reasons, so this is the only time you will be able to record it. If you lose or forget your API key, you will have to revoke it and generate a new one.

Every request must specify an API key via a request header.

The API key must be specified in the URL header. The API will return a 404 (rather than a 403) in response to a request with a missing or incorrect API key in order to prevent leaking the existence of resources to unauthorized users.

## Versioning
Once an API version is released, we will make only backwards-compatible changes to it. Backwards-compatible changes include:

* Adding new API resources

* Adding new optional request parameters to existing API methods

* Adding new properties to existing API responses

* Changing the order of properties in existing API responses

## Rate Limit
* The Dashboard API is limited to **5 calls per second**, per organization.
* A burst of 5 additional calls are allowed in the first second, so a maximum of 15 calls in the first 2 seconds.
* The rate limiting technique is based off of the [token bucket model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Token_bucket).
* An error with a `429` status code will be returned when the rate limit has been exceeded.
* Expect to backoff for 1 - 2 seconds if the limit has been exceeded. You may have to wait potentially longer if a large number of requests were made within this timeframe.


## Additional Details
Identifiers in the API are opaque strings. A `{networkId}`, for example, might be the string "126043", whereas an `{orderId}` might contain characters, such as "4S1234567". Client applications must not try to parse them as numbers. Even identifiers that look like numbers might be too long to encode without loss of precision in Javascript, where the only numeric type is IEEE 754 floating point.

Verbs in the API follow the usual REST conventions:

`GET` returns the value of a resource or a list of resources, depending on whether an identifier is specified. For example, a `GET` of `/organizations` returns a list of organizations, whereas a `GET` of `/organizations/{organizationId}` returns a particular organization.

`POST` adds a new resource, as in a `POST` to `/organizations/{organizationId}/admins`, or performs some other non-idempotent change.

`PUT` updates a resource. `PUTs` are idempotent; they update a resource, creating it first if it does not already exist. A `PUT` should specify all the fields of a resource; the API will revert omitted fields to their default value.

`DELETE` removes a resource.

## What can the API be used for?
The Dashboard API can be used for many purposes. It's meant to be an open-ended tool. Here are some examples of use cases:

* Add new organizations, admins, networks, devices, VLANs, and more
* Configure networks at scale
* Automatically on-board and off-board new employees' teleworker setups
* Build your own dashboard for store managers, field techs, or unique use cases

Client applications must not try to parse them as numbers. Even identifiers that look like numbers might be too long to encode without loss of precision in Javascript, where the only numeric type is IEEE 754 floating point.

Verbs in the API follow the usual REST conventions:

`GET` returns the value of a resource or a list of resources, depending on whether an identifier is specified. For example, a `GET` of `/organizations` returns a list of organizations, whereas a `GET` of `/organizations/{organizationId}` returns a particular organization.

`POST` adds a new resource, as in a `POST` to `/organizations/{organizationId}/admins`, or performs some other non-idempotent change.

`PUT` updates a resource. `PUTs` are idempotent; they update a resource, creating it first if it does not already exist. A `PUT` should specify all the fields of a resource; the API will revert omitted fields to their default value.

`DELETE` removes a resource.

/**
 * Update the syslog servers for a network
 * @method
 * @name MerakiDashboardApi#updateNetworkSyslogServers
 * @param {object} parameters - method options and parameters
     * @param {string} parameters.networkId - The Cisco Meraki Dashboard API is a modern REST API based on the [OpenAPI](https://swagger.io/docs/specification/about/) specification.

## What can the API be used for?
The Dashboard API can be used for many purposes. It's meant to be an open-ended tool. Here are some examples of use cases:

* Add new organizations, admins, networks, devices, VLANs, and more
* Configure networks at scale
* Automatically on-board and off-board new employees' teleworker setups
* Build your own dashboard for store managers, field techs, or unique use cases

## Enabling the Dashboard API
1. Begin by logging into [Meraki Dashboard](https://dashboard.meraki.com) and navigating to **Organization > Settings**

2. Locate the section titled **Dashboard API access** and select **Enable Access**, then **Save** your changes

3. After enabling the API, choose your username at the top-right of the Meraki Dashboard and select **my profile**

4. Locate the section titled **Dashboard API access** and select **Generate new API key**

*Note: The API key is associated with a Dashboard administrator account. You can generate, revoke, and regenerate your API key on your profile.*

**Keep your API key safe as it provides authentication to all of your organizations with the API enabled. If your API key is shared, you can regenerate your API key at any time. This will revoke the existing API key.**

Copy and store your API key in a safe place. Dashboard does not store API keys in plaintext for security reasons, so this is the only time you will be able to record it. If you lose or forget your API key, you will have to revoke it and generate a new one.

Every request must specify an API key via a request header.

The API key must be specified in the URL header. The API will return a 404 (rather than a 403) in response to a request with a missing or incorrect API key in order to prevent leaking the existence of resources to unauthorized users.

## Versioning
Once an API version is released, we will make only backwards-compatible changes to it. Backwards-compatible changes include:

* Adding new API resources

* Adding new optional request parameters to existing API methods

* Adding new properties to existing API responses

* Changing the order of properties in existing API responses

## Rate Limit
* The Dashboard API is limited to **5 calls per second**, per organization.
* A burst of 5 additional calls are allowed in the first second, so a maximum of 15 calls in the first 2 seconds.
* The rate limiting technique is based off of the [token bucket model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Token_bucket).
* An error with a `429` status code will be returned when the rate limit has been exceeded.
* Expect to backoff for 1 - 2 seconds if the limit has been exceeded. You may have to wait potentially longer if a large number of requests were made within this timeframe.

## Versioning
Once an API version is released, we will make only backwards-compatible changes to it. Backwards-compatible changes include:

* Adding new API resources

* Adding new optional request parameters to existing API methods

* Adding new properties to existing API responses

* Changing the order of properties in existing API responses

## Rate Limit
* The Dashboard API is limited to **5 calls per second**, per organization.
* A burst of 5 additional calls are allowed in the first second, so a maximum of 15 calls in the first 2 seconds.
* The rate limiting technique is based off of the [token bucket model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Token_bucket).
* An error with a `429` status code will be returned when the rate limit has been exceeded.
* Expect to backoff for 1 - 2 seconds if the limit has been exceeded. You may have to wait potentially longer if a large number of requests were made within this timeframe.


## Additional Details
Identifiers in the API are opaque strings. A `{networkId}`, for example, might be the string "126043", whereas an `{orderId}` might contain characters, such as "4S1234567". Client applications must not try to parse them as numbers. Even identifiers that look like numbers might be too long to encode without loss of precision in Javascript, where the only numeric type is IEEE 754 floating point.

Verbs in the API follow the usual REST conventions:

`GET` returns the value of a resource or a list of resources, depending on whether an identifier is specified. For example, a `GET` of `/organizations` returns a list of organizations, whereas a `GET` of `/organizations/{organizationId}` returns a particular organization.

`POST` adds a new resource, as in a `POST` to `/organizations/{organizationId}/admins`, or performs some other non-idempotent change.

`PUT` updates a resource. `PUTs` are idempotent; they update a resource, creating it first if it does not already exist. A `PUT` should specify all the fields of a resource; the API will revert omitted fields to their default value.

`DELETE` removes a resource.

     * @param {string} parameters.networkId - The Cisco Meraki Dashboard API is a modern REST API based on the [OpenAPI](https://swagger.io/docs/specification/about/) specification.

## What can the API be used for?
The Dashboard API can be used for many purposes. It's meant to be an open-ended tool. Here are some examples of use cases:

* Add new organizations, admins, networks, devices, VLANs, and more
* Configure networks at scale
* Automatically on-board and off-board new employees' teleworker setups
* Build your own dashboard for store managers, field techs, or unique use cases

## Enabling the Dashboard API
1. Begin by logging into [Meraki Dashboard](https://dashboard.meraki.com) and navigating to **Organization > Settings**

2. Locate the section titled **Dashboard API access** and select **Enable Access**, then **Save** your changes

3. After enabling the API, choose your username at the top-right of the Meraki Dashboard and select **my profile**

4. Locate the section titled **Dashboard API access** and select **Generate new API key**

*Note: The API key is associated with a Dashboard administrator account. You can generate, revoke, and regenerate your API key on your profile.*

**Keep your API key safe as it provides authentication to all of your organizations with the API enabled. If your API key is shared, you can regenerate your API key at any time. This will revoke the existing API key.**

Copy and store your API key in a safe place. Dashboard does not store API keys in plaintext for security reasons, so this is the only time you will be able to record it. If you lose or forget your API key, you will have to revoke it and generate a new one.

Every request must specify an API key via a request header.

The API key must be specified in the URL header. The API will return a 404 (rather than a 403) in response to a request with a missing or incorrect API key in order to prevent leaking the existence of resources to unauthorized users.

4. Locate the section titled **Dashboard API access** and select **Generate new API key**

*Note: The API key is associated with a Dashboard administrator account. You can generate, revoke, and regenerate your API key on your profile.*

**Keep your API key safe as it provides authentication to all of your organizations with the API enabled. If your API key is shared, you can regenerate your API key at any time. This will revoke the existing API key.**

Copy and store your API key in a safe place. Dashboard does not store API keys in plaintext for security reasons, so this is the only time you will be able to record it. If you lose or forget your API key, you will have to revoke it and generate a new one.

Every request must specify an API key via a request header.

The API key must be specified in the URL header. The API will return a 404 (rather than a 403) in response to a request with a missing or incorrect API key in order to prevent leaking the existence of resources to unauthorized users.

## Versioning
Once an API version is released, we will make only backwards-compatible changes to it. Backwards-compatible changes include:

* Adding new API resources

* Adding new optional request parameters to existing API methods

* Adding new properties to existing API responses

* Changing the order of properties in existing API responses

## Rate Limit
* The Dashboard API is limited to **5 calls per second**, per organization.
* A burst of 5 additional calls are allowed in the first second, so a maximum of 15 calls in the first 2 seconds.
* The rate limiting technique is based off of the [token bucket model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Token_bucket).
* An error with a `429` status code will be returned when the rate limit has been exceeded.
* Expect to backoff for 1 - 2 seconds if the limit has been exceeded. You may have to wait potentially longer if a large number of requests were made within this timeframe.


## Additional Details
Identifiers in the API are opaque strings. A `{networkId}`, for example, might be the string "126043", whereas an `{orderId}` might contain characters, such as "4S1234567". Client applications must not try to parse them as numbers. Even identifiers that look like numbers might be too long to encode without loss of precision in Javascript, where the only numeric type is IEEE 754 floating point.

Verbs in the API follow the usual REST conventions:

`GET` returns the value of a resource or a list of resources, depending on whether an identifier is specified. For example, a `GET` of `/organizations` returns a list of organizations, whereas a `GET` of `/organizations/{organizationId}` returns a particular organization.

`POST` adds a new resource, as in a `POST` to `/organizations/{organizationId}/admins`, or performs some other non-idempotent change.

`PUT` updates a resource. `PUTs` are idempotent; they update a resource, creating it first if it does not already exist. A `PUT` should specify all the fields of a resource; the API will revert omitted fields to their default value.

`DELETE` removes a resource.

The Dashboard API can be used for many purposes. It's meant to be an open-ended tool. Here are some examples of use cases:

* Add new organizations, admins, networks, devices, VLANs, and more
* Configure networks at scale
* Automatically on-board and off-board new employees' teleworker setups
* Build your own dashboard for store managers, field techs, or unique use cases

* Adding new properties to existing API responses

* Changing the order of properties in existing API responses

## Rate Limit
* The Dashboard API is limited to **5 calls per second**, per organization.
* A burst of 5 additional calls are allowed in the first second, so a maximum of 15 calls in the first 2 seconds.
* The rate limiting technique is based off of the [token bucket model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Token_bucket).
* An error with a `429` status code will be returned when the rate limit has been exceeded.
* Expect to backoff for 1 - 2 seconds if the limit has been exceeded. You may have to wait potentially longer if a large number of requests were made within this timeframe.


## Additional Details
Identifiers in the API are opaque strings. A `{networkId}`, for example, might be the string "126043", whereas an `{orderId}` might contain characters, such as "4S1234567". Client applications must not try to parse them as numbers. Even identifiers that look like numbers might be too long to encode without loss of precision in Javascript, where the only numeric type is IEEE 754 floating point.

Verbs in the API follow the usual REST conventions:

`GET` returns the value of a resource or a list of resources, depending on whether an identifier is specified. For example, a `GET` of `/organizations` returns a list of organizations, whereas a `GET` of `/organizations/{organizationId}` returns a particular organization.

`POST` adds a new resource, as in a `POST` to `/organizations/{organizationId}/admins`, or performs some other non-idempotent change.

`PUT` updates a resource. `PUTs` are idempotent; they update a resource, creating it first if it does not already exist. A `PUT` should specify all the fields of a resource; the API will revert omitted fields to their default value.

`DELETE` removes a resource.

/**
 * Return a VLAN
 * @method
 * @name MerakiDashboardApi#getNetworkVlan
 * @param {object} parameters - method options and parameters
     * @param {string} parameters.networkId - The Cisco Meraki Dashboard API is a modern REST API based on the [OpenAPI](https://swagger.io/docs/specification/about/) specification.

## What can the API be used for?
The Dashboard API can be used for many purposes. It's meant to be an open-ended tool. Here are some examples of use cases:

* Add new organizations, admins, networks, devices, VLANs, and more
* Configure networks at scale
* Automatically on-board and off-board new employees' teleworker setups
* Build your own dashboard for store managers, field techs, or unique use cases

## Enabling the Dashboard API
1. Begin by logging into [Meraki Dashboard](https://dashboard.meraki.com) and navigating to **Organization > Settings**

2. Locate the section titled **Dashboard API access** and select **Enable Access**, then **Save** your changes

3. After enabling the API, choose your username at the top-right of the Meraki Dashboard and select **my profile**

4. Locate the section titled **Dashboard API access** and select **Generate new API key**

*Note: The API key is associated with a Dashboard administrator account. You can generate, revoke, and regenerate your API key on your profile.*

**Keep your API key safe as it provides authentication to all of your organizations with the API enabled. If your API key is shared, you can regenerate your API key at any time. This will revoke the existing API key.**

Copy and store your API key in a safe place. Dashboard does not store API keys in plaintext for security reasons, so this is the only time you will be able to record it. If you lose or forget your API key, you will have to revoke it and generate a new one.

Every request must specify an API key via a request header.

The API key must be specified in the URL header. The API will return a 404 (rather than a 403) in response to a request with a missing or incorrect API key in order to prevent leaking the existence of resources to unauthorized users.

## Versioning
Once an API version is released, we will make only backwards-compatible changes to it. Backwards-compatible changes include:

* Adding new API resources

* Adding new optional request parameters to existing API methods

* Adding new properties to existing API responses

* Changing the order of properties in existing API responses

## Rate Limit
* The Dashboard API is limited to **5 calls per second**, per organization.
* A burst of 5 additional calls are allowed in the first second, so a maximum of 15 calls in the first 2 seconds.
* The rate limiting technique is based off of the [token bucket model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Token_bucket).
* An error with a `429` status code will be returned when the rate limit has been exceeded.
* Expect to backoff for 1 - 2 seconds if the limit has been exceeded. You may have to wait potentially longer if a large number of requests were made within this timeframe.

`GET` returns the value of a resource or a list of resources, depending on whether an identifier is specified. For example, a `GET` of `/organizations` returns a list of organizations, whereas a `GET` of `/organizations/{organizationId}` returns a particular organization.

`POST` adds a new resource, as in a `POST` to `/organizations/{organizationId}/admins`, or performs some other non-idempotent change.

`PUT` updates a resource. `PUTs` are idempotent; they update a resource, creating it first if it does not already exist. A `PUT` should specify all the fields of a resource; the API will revert omitted fields to their default value.

`DELETE` removes a resource.

     * @param {string} parameters.vlanId - The Cisco Meraki Dashboard API is a modern REST API based on the [OpenAPI](https://swagger.io/docs/specification/about/) specification.

## What can the API be used for?
The Dashboard API can be used for many purposes. It's meant to be an open-ended tool. Here are some examples of use cases:

* Add new organizations, admins, networks, devices, VLANs, and more
* Configure networks at scale
* Automatically on-board and off-board new employees' teleworker setups
* Build your own dashboard for store managers, field techs, or unique use cases

## Enabling the Dashboard API
1. Begin by logging into [Meraki Dashboard](https://dashboard.meraki.com) and navigating to **Organization > Settings**

2. Locate the section titled **Dashboard API access** and select **Enable Access**, then **Save** your changes

3. After enabling the API, choose your username at the top-right of the Meraki Dashboard and select **my profile**

4. Locate the section titled **Dashboard API access** and select **Generate new API key**

*Note: The API key is associated with a Dashboard administrator account. You can generate, revoke, and regenerate your API key on your profile.*

**Keep your API key safe as it provides authentication to all of your organizations with the API enabled. If your API key is shared, you can regenerate your API key at any time. This will revoke the existing API key.**

Copy and store your API key in a safe place. Dashboard does not store API keys in plaintext for security reasons, so this is the only time you will be able to record it. If you lose or forget your API key, you will have to revoke it and generate a new one.

Every request must specify an API key via a request header.

The API key must be specified in the URL header. The API will return a 404 (rather than a 403) in response to a request with a missing or incorrect API key in order to prevent leaking the existence of resources to unauthorized users.

## Versioning
Once an API version is released, we will make only backwards-compatible changes to it. Backwards-compatible changes include:

* Adding new API resources

* Adding new optional request parameters to existing API methods

* Adding new properties to existing API responses

* Changing the order of properties in existing API responses

## Rate Limit
* The Dashboard API is limited to **5 calls per second**, per organization.
* A burst of 5 additional calls are allowed in the first second, so a maximum of 15 calls in the first 2 seconds.
* The rate limiting technique is based off of the [token bucket model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Token_bucket).
* An error with a `429` status code will be returned when the rate limit has been exceeded.
* Expect to backoff for 1 - 2 seconds if the limit has been exceeded. You may have to wait potentially longer if a large number of requests were made within this timeframe.


## Additional Details
Identifiers in the API are opaque strings. A `{networkId}`, for example, might be the string "126043", whereas an `{orderId}` might contain characters, such as "4S1234567". Client applications must not try to parse them as numbers. Even identifiers that look like numbers might be too long to encode without loss of precision in Javascript, where the only numeric type is IEEE 754 floating point.

`PUT` updates a resource. `PUTs` are idempotent; they update a resource, creating it first if it does not already exist. A `PUT` should specify all the fields of a resource; the API will revert omitted fields to their default value.

`DELETE` removes a resource.

     * @param {} parameters.updateNetworkWarmSpareSettings - The Cisco Meraki Dashboard API is a modern REST API based on the [OpenAPI](https://swagger.io/docs/specification/about/) specification.

## What can the API be used for?
The Dashboard API can be used for many purposes. It's meant to be an open-ended tool. Here are some examples of use cases:

* Add new organizations, admins, networks, devices, VLANs, and more
* Configure networks at scale
* Automatically on-board and off-board new employees' teleworker setups
* Build your own dashboard for store managers, field techs, or unique use cases

## Enabling the Dashboard API
1. Begin by logging into [Meraki Dashboard](https://dashboard.meraki.com) and navigating to **Organization > Settings**

2. Locate the section titled **Dashboard API access** and select **Enable Access**, then **Save** your changes

3. After enabling the API, choose your username at the top-right of the Meraki Dashboard and select **my profile**

4. Locate the section titled **Dashboard API access** and select **Generate new API key**

*Note: The API key is associated with a Dashboard administrator account. You can generate, revoke, and regenerate your API key on your profile.*

**Keep your API key safe as it provides authentication to all of your organizations with the API enabled. If your API key is shared, you can regenerate your API key at any time. This will revoke the existing API key.**

Copy and store your API key in a safe place. Dashboard does not store API keys in plaintext for security reasons, so this is the only time you will be able to record it. If you lose or forget your API key, you will have to revoke it and generate a new one.

Every request must specify an API key via a request header.

The API key must be specified in the URL header. The API will return a 404 (rather than a 403) in response to a request with a missing or incorrect API key in order to prevent leaking the existence of resources to unauthorized users.

## Versioning
Once an API version is released, we will make only backwards-compatible changes to it. Backwards-compatible changes include:

* Adding new API resources

* Adding new optional request parameters to existing API methods

* Adding new properties to existing API responses

* Changing the order of properties in existing API responses

## Rate Limit
* The Dashboard API is limited to **5 calls per second**, per organization.
* A burst of 5 additional calls are allowed in the first second, so a maximum of 15 calls in the first 2 seconds.
* The rate limiting technique is based off of the [token bucket model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Token_bucket).
* An error with a `429` status code will be returned when the rate limit has been exceeded.
* Expect to backoff for 1 - 2 seconds if the limit has been exceeded. You may have to wait potentially longer if a large number of requests were made within this timeframe.


## Additional Details
Identifiers in the API are opaque strings. A `{networkId}`, for example, might be the string "126043", whereas an `{orderId}` might contain characters, such as "4S1234567". Client applications must not try to parse them as numbers. Even identifiers that look like numbers might be too long to encode without loss of precision in Javascript, where the only numeric type is IEEE 754 floating point.

Verbs in the API follow the usual REST conventions:

`GET` returns the value of a resource or a list of resources, depending on whether an identifier is specified. For example, a `GET` of `/organizations` returns a list of organizations, whereas a `GET` of `/organizations/{organizationId}` returns a particular organization.

`POST` adds a new resource, as in a `POST` to `/organizations/{organizationId}/admins`, or performs some other non-idempotent change.

`PUT` updates a resource. `PUTs` are idempotent; they update a resource, creating it first if it does not already exist. A `PUT` should specify all the fields of a resource; the API will revert omitted fields to their default value.

`DELETE` removes a resource.

1. Begin by logging into [Meraki Dashboard](https://dashboard.meraki.com) and navigating to **Organization > Settings**

2. Locate the section titled **Dashboard API access** and select **Enable Access**, then **Save** your changes

3. After enabling the API, choose your username at the top-right of the Meraki Dashboard and select **my profile**

4. Locate the section titled **Dashboard API access** and select **Generate new API key**

*Note: The API key is associated with a Dashboard administrator account. You can generate, revoke, and regenerate your API key on your profile.*

**Keep your API key safe as it provides authentication to all of your organizations with the API enabled. If your API key is shared, you can regenerate your API key at any time. This will revoke the existing API key.**

Copy and store your API key in a safe place. Dashboard does not store API keys in plaintext for security reasons, so this is the only time you will be able to record it. If you lose or forget your API key, you will have to revoke it and generate a new one.

Every request must specify an API key via a request header.

The API key must be specified in the URL header. The API will return a 404 (rather than a 403) in response to a request with a missing or incorrect API key in order to prevent leaking the existence of resources to unauthorized users.

## Versioning
Once an API version is released, we will make only backwards-compatible changes to it. Backwards-compatible changes include:

* Adding new API resources

* Adding new optional request parameters to existing API methods

* Adding new properties to existing API responses

* Changing the order of properties in existing API responses

## Rate Limit
* The Dashboard API is limited to **5 calls per second**, per organization.
* A burst of 5 additional calls are allowed in the first second, so a maximum of 15 calls in the first 2 seconds.
* The rate limiting technique is based off of the [token bucket model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Token_bucket).
* An error with a `429` status code will be returned when the rate limit has been exceeded.
* Expect to backoff for 1 - 2 seconds if the limit has been exceeded. You may have to wait potentially longer if a large number of requests were made within this timeframe.


## Additional Details
Identifiers in the API are opaque strings. A `{networkId}`, for example, might be the string "126043", whereas an `{orderId}` might contain characters, such as "4S1234567". Client applications must not try to parse them as numbers. Even identifiers that look like numbers might be too long to encode without loss of precision in Javascript, where the only numeric type is IEEE 754 floating point.

Verbs in the API follow the usual REST conventions:

`GET` returns the value of a resource or a list of resources, depending on whether an identifier is specified. For example, a `GET` of `/organizations` returns a list of organizations, whereas a `GET` of `/organizations/{organizationId}` returns a particular organization.

`POST` adds a new resource, as in a `POST` to `/organizations/{organizationId}/admins`, or performs some other non-idempotent change.

`PUT` updates a resource. `PUTs` are idempotent; they update a resource, creating it first if it does not already exist. A `PUT` should specify all the fields of a resource; the API will revert omitted fields to their default value.

`DELETE` removes a resource.

The Dashboard API can be used for many purposes. It's meant to be an open-ended tool. Here are some examples of use cases:

* Add new organizations, admins, networks, devices, VLANs, and more
* Configure networks at scale
* Automatically on-board and off-board new employees' teleworker setups
* Build your own dashboard for store managers, field techs, or unique use cases

* Add new organizations, admins, networks, devices, VLANs, and more
* Configure networks at scale
* Automatically on-board and off-board new employees' teleworker setups
* Build your own dashboard for store managers, field techs, or unique use cases

## Enabling the Dashboard API
1. Begin by logging into [Meraki Dashboard](https://dashboard.meraki.com) and navigating to **Organization > Settings**

2. Locate the section titled **Dashboard API access** and select **Enable Access**, then **Save** your changes

3. After enabling the API, choose your username at the top-right of the Meraki Dashboard and select **my profile**

4. Locate the section titled **Dashboard API access** and select **Generate new API key**

*Note: The API key is associated with a Dashboard administrator account. You can generate, revoke, and regenerate your API key on your profile.*

**Keep your API key safe as it provides authentication to all of your organizations with the API enabled. If your API key is shared, you can regenerate your API key at any time. This will revoke the existing API key.**

Copy and store your API key in a safe place. Dashboard does not store API keys in plaintext for security reasons, so this is the only time you will be able to record it. If you lose or forget your API key, you will have to revoke it and generate a new one.

Every request must specify an API key via a request header.

The API key must be specified in the URL header. The API will return a 404 (rather than a 403) in response to a request with a missing or incorrect API key in order to prevent leaking the existence of resources to unauthorized users.

## Versioning
Once an API version is released, we will make only backwards-compatible changes to it. Backwards-compatible changes include:

* Adding new API resources

* Adding new optional request parameters to existing API methods

* Adding new properties to existing API responses

* Changing the order of properties in existing API responses

## Rate Limit
* The Dashboard API is limited to **5 calls per second**, per organization.
* A burst of 5 additional calls are allowed in the first second, so a maximum of 15 calls in the first 2 seconds.
* The rate limiting technique is based off of the [token bucket model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Token_bucket).
* An error with a `429` status code will be returned when the rate limit has been exceeded.
* Expect to backoff for 1 - 2 seconds if the limit has been exceeded. You may have to wait potentially longer if a large number of requests were made within this timeframe.


## Additional Details
Identifiers in the API are opaque strings. A `{networkId}`, for example, might be the string "126043", whereas an `{orderId}` might contain characters, such as "4S1234567". Client applications must not try to parse them as numbers. Even identifiers that look like numbers might be too long to encode without loss of precision in Javascript, where the only numeric type is IEEE 754 floating point.

Verbs in the API follow the usual REST conventions:

`GET` returns the value of a resource or a list of resources, depending on whether an identifier is specified. For example, a `GET` of `/organizations` returns a list of organizations, whereas a `GET` of `/organizations/{organizationId}` returns a particular organization.

`POST` adds a new resource, as in a `POST` to `/organizations/{organizationId}/admins`, or performs some other non-idempotent change.

`PUT` updates a resource. `PUTs` are idempotent; they update a resource, creating it first if it does not already exist. A `PUT` should specify all the fields of a resource; the API will revert omitted fields to their default value.

`DELETE` removes a resource.

* Add new organizations, admins, networks, devices, VLANs, and more
* Configure networks at scale
* Automatically on-board and off-board new employees' teleworker setups
* Build your own dashboard for store managers, field techs, or unique use cases

## Enabling the Dashboard API
1. Begin by logging into [Meraki Dashboard](https://dashboard.meraki.com) and navigating to **Organization > Settings**

2. Locate the section titled **Dashboard API access** and select **Enable Access**, then **Save** your changes

3. After enabling the API, choose your username at the top-right of the Meraki Dashboard and select **my profile**

4. Locate the section titled **Dashboard API access** and select **Generate new API key**

*Note: The API key is associated with a Dashboard administrator account. You can generate, revoke, and regenerate your API key on your profile.*

**Keep your API key safe as it provides authentication to all of your organizations with the API enabled. If your API key is shared, you can regenerate your API key at any time. This will revoke the existing API key.**

Copy and store your API key in a safe place. Dashboard does not store API keys in plaintext for security reasons, so this is the only time you will be able to record it. If you lose or forget your API key, you will have to revoke it and generate a new one.

Every request must specify an API key via a request header.

The API key must be specified in the URL header. The API will return a 404 (rather than a 403) in response to a request with a missing or incorrect API key in order to prevent leaking the existence of resources to unauthorized users.

## Versioning
Once an API version is released, we will make only backwards-compatible changes to it. Backwards-compatible changes include:

* Adding new API resources

* Adding new optional request parameters to existing API methods

* Adding new properties to existing API responses

* Changing the order of properties in existing API responses

## Rate Limit
* The Dashboard API is limited to **5 calls per second**, per organization.
* A burst of 5 additional calls are allowed in the first second, so a maximum of 15 calls in the first 2 seconds.
* The rate limiting technique is based off of the [token bucket model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Token_bucket).
* An error with a `429` status code will be returned when the rate limit has been exceeded.
* Expect to backoff for 1 - 2 seconds if the limit has been exceeded. You may have to wait potentially longer if a large number of requests were made within this timeframe.


## Additional Details
Identifiers in the API are opaque strings. A `{networkId}`, for example, might be the string "126043", whereas an `{orderId}` might contain characters, such as "4S1234567". Client applications must not try to parse them as numbers. Even identifiers that look like numbers might be too long to encode without loss of precision in Javascript, where the only numeric type is IEEE 754 floating point.

Verbs in the API follow the usual REST conventions:

`GET` returns the value of a resource or a list of resources, depending on whether an identifier is specified. For example, a `GET` of `/organizations` returns a list of organizations, whereas a `GET` of `/organizations/{organizationId}` returns a particular organization.

`POST` adds a new resource, as in a `POST` to `/organizations/{organizationId}/admins`, or performs some other non-idempotent change.

`PUT` updates a resource. `PUTs` are idempotent; they update a resource, creating it first if it does not already exist. A `PUT` should specify all the fields of a resource; the API will revert omitted fields to their default value.

`DELETE` removes a resource.

`PUT` updates a resource. `PUTs` are idempotent; they update a resource, creating it first if it does not already exist. A `PUT` should specify all the fields of a resource; the API will revert omitted fields to their default value.

`DELETE` removes a resource.

     * @param {string} parameters.perPage - The number of entries per page returned
     * @param {string} parameters.startingAfter - A token used by the server to indicate the start of the page. Often this is a timestamp or an ID but it is not limited to those. This parameter should not be defined by client applications. The link for the first, last, next or prev page in the HTTP Link header should define it.
     * @param {string} parameters.endingBefore - A token used by the server to indicate the end of the page. Often this is a timestamp or an ID but it is not limited to those.

 * Create a new organization

 * @param {object} parameters - method options and parameters
     * @param {} parameters.createOrganization - The Cisco Meraki Dashboard API is a modern REST API based on the [OpenAPI](https://swagger.io/docs/specification/about/) specification.

## What can the API be used for?
The Dashboard API can be used for many purposes. It's meant to be an open-ended tool. Here are some examples of use cases:

* Add new organizations, admins, networks, devices, VLANs, and more
* Configure networks at scale
* Automatically on-board and off-board new employees' teleworker setups
* Build your own dashboard for store managers, field techs, or unique use cases

## Enabling the Dashboard API
1. Begin by logging into [Meraki Dashboard](https://dashboard.meraki.com) and navigating to **Organization > Settings**

2. Locate the section titled **Dashboard API access** and select **Enable Access**, then **Save** your changes

3. After enabling the API, choose your username at the top-right of the Meraki Dashboard and select **my profile**

4. Locate the section titled **Dashboard API access** and select **Generate new API key**

*Note: The API key is associated with a Dashboard administrator account. You can generate, revoke, and regenerate your API key on your profile.*

**Keep your API key safe as it provides authentication to all of your organizations with the API enabled. If your API key is shared, you can regenerate your API key at any time. This will revoke the existing API key.**

Copy and store your API key in a safe place. Dashboard does not store API keys in plaintext for security reasons, so this is the only time you will be able to record it. If you lose or forget your API key, you will have to revoke it and generate a new one.

Every request must specify an API key via a request header.

The API key must be specified in the URL header. The API will return a 404 (rather than a 403) in response to a request with a missing or incorrect API key in order to prevent leaking the existence of resources to unauthorized users.

## Versioning
Once an API version is released, we will make only backwards-compatible changes to it. Backwards-compatible changes include:

* Adding new API resources

* Adding new optional request parameters to existing API methods

* Adding new properties to existing API responses

* Changing the order of properties in existing API responses

## Rate Limit
* The Dashboard API is limited to **5 calls per second**, per organization.
* A burst of 5 additional calls are allowed in the first second, so a maximum of 15 calls in the first 2 seconds.
* The rate limiting technique is based off of the [token bucket model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Token_bucket).
* An error with a `429` status code will be returned when the rate limit has been exceeded.
* Expect to backoff for 1 - 2 seconds if the limit has been exceeded. You may have to wait potentially longer if a large number of requests were made within this timeframe.


## Additional Details
Identifiers in the API are opaque strings. A `{networkId}`, for example, might be the string "126043", whereas an `{orderId}` might contain characters, such as "4S1234567". Client applications must not try to parse them as numbers. Even identifiers that look like numbers might be too long to encode without loss of precision in Javascript, where the only numeric type is IEEE 754 floating point.

Verbs in the API follow the usual REST conventions:

`GET` returns the value of a resource or a list of resources, depending on whether an identifier is specified. For example, a `GET` of `/organizations` returns a list of organizations, whereas a `GET` of `/organizations/{organizationId}` returns a particular organization.

`POST` adds a new resource, as in a `POST` to `/organizations/{organizationId}/admins`, or performs some other non-idempotent change.

`PUT` updates a resource. `PUTs` are idempotent; they update a resource, creating it first if it does not already exist. A `PUT` should specify all the fields of a resource; the API will revert omitted fields to their default value.

`DELETE` removes a resource.

 * @name MerakiDashboardApi#createOrganizationActionBatch
 * @param {object} parameters - method options and parameters
     * @param {string} parameters.organizationId - The Cisco Meraki Dashboard API is a modern REST API based on the [OpenAPI](https://swagger.io/docs/specification/about/) specification.

## What can the API be used for?
The Dashboard API can be used for many purposes. It's meant to be an open-ended tool. Here are some examples of use cases:

* Add new organizations, admins, networks, devices, VLANs, and more
* Configure networks at scale
* Automatically on-board and off-board new employees' teleworker setups
* Build your own dashboard for store managers, field techs, or unique use cases

## Enabling the Dashboard API
1. Begin by logging into [Meraki Dashboard](https://dashboard.meraki.com) and navigating to **Organization > Settings**

2. Locate the section titled **Dashboard API access** and select **Enable Access**, then **Save** your changes

3. After enabling the API, choose your username at the top-right of the Meraki Dashboard and select **my profile**

4. Locate the section titled **Dashboard API access** and select **Generate new API key**

*Note: The API key is associated with a Dashboard administrator account. You can generate, revoke, and regenerate your API key on your profile.*

**Keep your API key safe as it provides authentication to all of your organizations with the API enabled. If your API key is shared, you can regenerate your API key at any time. This will revoke the existing API key.**

Copy and store your API key in a safe place. Dashboard does not store API keys in plaintext for security reasons, so this is the only time you will be able to record it. If you lose or forget your API key, you will have to revoke it and generate a new one.

Every request must specify an API key via a request header.

The API key must be specified in the URL header. The API will return a 404 (rather than a 403) in response to a request with a missing or incorrect API key in order to prevent leaking the existence of resources to unauthorized users.

## Versioning
Once an API version is released, we will make only backwards-compatible changes to it. Backwards-compatible changes include:

* Adding new API resources

* Adding new optional request parameters to existing API methods

* Adding new properties to existing API responses

* Changing the order of properties in existing API responses

## Rate Limit
* The Dashboard API is limited to **5 calls per second**, per organization.
* A burst of 5 additional calls are allowed in the first second, so a maximum of 15 calls in the first 2 seconds.
* The rate limiting technique is based off of the [token bucket model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Token_bucket).
* An error with a `429` status code will be returned when the rate limit has been exceeded.
* Expect to backoff for 1 - 2 seconds if the limit has been exceeded. You may have to wait potentially longer if a large number of requests were made within this timeframe.


## Additional Details
Identifiers in the API are opaque strings. A `{networkId}`, for example, might be the string "126043", whereas an `{orderId}` might contain characters, such as "4S1234567". Client applications must not try to parse them as numbers. Even identifiers that look like numbers might be too long to encode without loss of precision in Javascript, where the only numeric type is IEEE 754 floating point.

Verbs in the API follow the usual REST conventions:

`GET` returns the value of a resource or a list of resources, depending on whether an identifier is specified. For example, a `GET` of `/organizations` returns a list of organizations, whereas a `GET` of `/organizations/{organizationId}` returns a particular organization.

`POST` adds a new resource, as in a `POST` to `/organizations/{organizationId}/admins`, or performs some other non-idempotent change.

`PUT` updates a resource. `PUTs` are idempotent; they update a resource, creating it first if it does not already exist. A `PUT` should specify all the fields of a resource; the API will revert omitted fields to their default value.

`DELETE` removes a resource.

Once an API version is released, we will make only backwards-compatible changes to it. Backwards-compatible changes include:

* Adding new API resources

* Adding new optional request parameters to existing API methods

* Adding new properties to existing API responses

* Changing the order of properties in existing API responses

## Rate Limit
* The Dashboard API is limited to **5 calls per second**, per organization.
* A burst of 5 additional calls are allowed in the first second, so a maximum of 15 calls in the first 2 seconds.
* The rate limiting technique is based off of the [token bucket model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Token_bucket).
* An error with a `429` status code will be returned when the rate limit has been exceeded.
* Expect to backoff for 1 - 2 seconds if the limit has been exceeded. You may have to wait potentially longer if a large number of requests were made within this timeframe.


## Additional Details
Identifiers in the API are opaque strings. A `{networkId}`, for example, might be the string "126043", whereas an `{orderId}` might contain characters, such as "4S1234567". Client applications must not try to parse them as numbers. Even identifiers that look like numbers might be too long to encode without loss of precision in Javascript, where the only numeric type is IEEE 754 floating point.

Verbs in the API follow the usual REST conventions:

`GET` returns the value of a resource or a list of resources, depending on whether an identifier is specified. For example, a `GET` of `/organizations` returns a list of organizations, whereas a `GET` of `/organizations/{organizationId}` returns a particular organization.

`POST` adds a new resource, as in a `POST` to `/organizations/{organizationId}/admins`, or performs some other non-idempotent change.

`PUT` updates a resource. `PUTs` are idempotent; they update a resource, creating it first if it does not already exist. A `PUT` should specify all the fields of a resource; the API will revert omitted fields to their default value.

`DELETE` removes a resource.

 * Update an action batch

 * @param {object} parameters - method options and parameters
     * @param {string} parameters.organizationId - The Cisco Meraki Dashboard API is a modern REST API based on the [OpenAPI](https://swagger.io/docs/specification/about/) specification.

## What can the API be used for?
The Dashboard API can be used for many purposes. It's meant to be an open-ended tool. Here are some examples of use cases:

* Add new organizations, admins, networks, devices, VLANs, and more
* Configure networks at scale
* Automatically on-board and off-board new employees' teleworker setups
* Build your own dashboard for store managers, field techs, or unique use cases

## Enabling the Dashboard API
1. Begin by logging into [Meraki Dashboard](https://dashboard.meraki.com) and navigating to **Organization > Settings**

2. Locate the section titled **Dashboard API access** and select **Enable Access**, then **Save** your changes

3. After enabling the API, choose your username at the top-right of the Meraki Dashboard and select **my profile**

4. Locate the section titled **Dashboard API access** and select **Generate new API key**

*Note: The API key is associated with a Dashboard administrator account. You can generate, revoke, and regenerate your API key on your profile.*

**Keep your API key safe as it provides authentication to all of your organizations with the API enabled. If your API key is shared, you can regenerate your API key at any time. This will revoke the existing API key.**

Copy and store your API key in a safe place. Dashboard does not store API keys in plaintext for security reasons, so this is the only time you will be able to record it. If you lose or forget your API key, you will have to revoke it and generate a new one.

Every request must specify an API key via a request header.

The API key must be specified in the URL header. The API will return a 404 (rather than a 403) in response to a request with a missing or incorrect API key in order to prevent leaking the existence of resources to unauthorized users.

/**
 * Update an administrator
 * @method
 * @name MerakiDashboardApi#updateOrganizationAdmin
 * @param {object} parameters - method options and parameters
     * @param {string} parameters.organizationId - The Cisco Meraki Dashboard API is a modern REST API based on the [OpenAPI](https://swagger.io/docs/specification/about/) specification.

## What can the API be used for?
The Dashboard API can be used for many purposes. It's meant to be an open-ended tool. Here are some examples of use cases:

* Add new organizations, admins, networks, devices, VLANs, and more
* Configure networks at scale
* Automatically on-board and off-board new employees' teleworker setups
* Build your own dashboard for store managers, field techs, or unique use cases

## Enabling the Dashboard API
1. Begin by logging into [Meraki Dashboard](https://dashboard.meraki.com) and navigating to **Organization > Settings**

2. Locate the section titled **Dashboard API access** and select **Enable Access**, then **Save** your changes

3. After enabling the API, choose your username at the top-right of the Meraki Dashboard and select **my profile**

4. Locate the section titled **Dashboard API access** and select **Generate new API key**

*Note: The API key is associated with a Dashboard administrator account. You can generate, revoke, and regenerate your API key on your profile.*

**Keep your API key safe as it provides authentication to all of your organizations with the API enabled. If your API key is shared, you can regenerate your API key at any time. This will revoke the existing API key.**

Copy and store your API key in a safe place. Dashboard does not store API keys in plaintext for security reasons, so this is the only time you will be able to record it. If you lose or forget your API key, you will have to revoke it and generate a new one.

Every request must specify an API key via a request header.

The API key must be specified in the URL header. The API will return a 404 (rather than a 403) in response to a request with a missing or incorrect API key in order to prevent leaking the existence of resources to unauthorized users.

## Versioning
Once an API version is released, we will make only backwards-compatible changes to it. Backwards-compatible changes include:

* Adding new API resources

* Adding new optional request parameters to existing API methods

* Adding new properties to existing API responses

* Changing the order of properties in existing API responses

## Rate Limit
* The Dashboard API is limited to **5 calls per second**, per organization.
* A burst of 5 additional calls are allowed in the first second, so a maximum of 15 calls in the first 2 seconds.
* The rate limiting technique is based off of the [token bucket model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Token_bucket).
* An error with a `429` status code will be returned when the rate limit has been exceeded.
* Expect to backoff for 1 - 2 seconds if the limit has been exceeded. You may have to wait potentially longer if a large number of requests were made within this timeframe.


## Additional Details
Identifiers in the API are opaque strings. A `{networkId}`, for example, might be the string "126043", whereas an `{orderId}` might contain characters, such as "4S1234567". Client applications must not try to parse them as numbers. Even identifiers that look like numbers might be too long to encode without loss of precision in Javascript, where the only numeric type is IEEE 754 floating point.

Verbs in the API follow the usual REST conventions:

`GET` returns the value of a resource or a list of resources, depending on whether an identifier is specified. For example, a `GET` of `/organizations` returns a list of organizations, whereas a `GET` of `/organizations/{organizationId}` returns a particular organization.

`POST` adds a new resource, as in a `POST` to `/organizations/{organizationId}/admins`, or performs some other non-idempotent change.

`PUT` updates a resource. `PUTs` are idempotent; they update a resource, creating it first if it does not already exist. A `PUT` should specify all the fields of a resource; the API will revert omitted fields to their default value.

`DELETE` removes a resource.

/**
 * List the branding policies of an organization
 * @method
 * @name MerakiDashboardApi#getOrganizationBrandingPolicies
 * @param {object} parameters - method options and parameters
     * @param {string} parameters.organizationId - The Cisco Meraki Dashboard API is a modern REST API based on the [OpenAPI](https://swagger.io/docs/specification/about/) specification.

## What can the API be used for?
The Dashboard API can be used for many purposes. It's meant to be an open-ended tool. Here are some examples of use cases:

* Add new organizations, admins, networks, devices, VLANs, and more
* Configure networks at scale
* Automatically on-board and off-board new employees' teleworker setups
* Build your own dashboard for store managers, field techs, or unique use cases

## Enabling the Dashboard API
1. Begin by logging into [Meraki Dashboard](https://dashboard.meraki.com) and navigating to **Organization > Settings**

2. Locate the section titled **Dashboard API access** and select **Enable Access**, then **Save** your changes

3. After enabling the API, choose your username at the top-right of the Meraki Dashboard and select **my profile**

4. Locate the section titled **Dashboard API access** and select **Generate new API key**

*Note: The API key is associated with a Dashboard administrator account. You can generate, revoke, and regenerate your API key on your profile.*

**Keep your API key safe as it provides authentication to all of your organizations with the API enabled. If your API key is shared, you can regenerate your API key at any time. This will revoke the existing API key.**

Copy and store your API key in a safe place. Dashboard does not store API keys in plaintext for security reasons, so this is the only time you will be able to record it. If you lose or forget your API key, you will have to revoke it and generate a new one.

Every request must specify an API key via a request header.

The API key must be specified in the URL header. The API will return a 404 (rather than a 403) in response to a request with a missing or incorrect API key in order to prevent leaking the existence of resources to unauthorized users.

## Versioning
Once an API version is released, we will make only backwards-compatible changes to it. Backwards-compatible changes include:

* Adding new API resources

* Adding new optional request parameters to existing API methods

* Adding new properties to existing API responses

* Changing the order of properties in existing API responses

## Rate Limit
* The Dashboard API is limited to **5 calls per second**, per organization.
* A burst of 5 additional calls are allowed in the first second, so a maximum of 15 calls in the first 2 seconds.
* The rate limiting technique is based off of the [token bucket model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Token_bucket).
* An error with a `429` status code will be returned when the rate limit has been exceeded.
* Expect to backoff for 1 - 2 seconds if the limit has been exceeded. You may have to wait potentially longer if a large number of requests were made within this timeframe.


## Additional Details
Identifiers in the API are opaque strings. A `{networkId}`, for example, might be the string "126043", whereas an `{orderId}` might contain characters, such as "4S1234567". Client applications must not try to parse them as numbers. Even identifiers that look like numbers might be too long to encode without loss of precision in Javascript, where the only numeric type is IEEE 754 floating point.

Verbs in the API follow the usual REST conventions:

`GET` returns the value of a resource or a list of resources, depending on whether an identifier is specified. For example, a `GET` of `/organizations` returns a list of organizations, whereas a `GET` of `/organizations/{organizationId}` returns a particular organization.

`POST` adds a new resource, as in a `POST` to `/organizations/{organizationId}/admins`, or performs some other non-idempotent change.

`PUT` updates a resource. `PUTs` are idempotent; they update a resource, creating it first if it does not already exist. A `PUT` should specify all the fields of a resource; the API will revert omitted fields to their default value.

`DELETE` removes a resource.

`PUT` updates a resource. `PUTs` are idempotent; they update a resource, creating it first if it does not already exist. A `PUT` should specify all the fields of a resource; the API will revert omitted fields to their default value.

`DELETE` removes a resource.

     * @param {} parameters.updateOrganizationBrandingPoliciesPriorities - The Cisco Meraki Dashboard API is a modern REST API based on the [OpenAPI](https://swagger.io/docs/specification/about/) specification.

## What can the API be used for?
The Dashboard API can be used for many purposes. It's meant to be an open-ended tool. Here are some examples of use cases:

* Add new organizations, admins, networks, devices, VLANs, and more
* Configure networks at scale
* Automatically on-board and off-board new employees' teleworker setups
* Build your own dashboard for store managers, field techs, or unique use cases

## Enabling the Dashboard API
1. Begin by logging into [Meraki Dashboard](https://dashboard.meraki.com) and navigating to **Organization > Settings**

2. Locate the section titled **Dashboard API access** and select **Enable Access**, then **Save** your changes

3. After enabling the API, choose your username at the top-right of the Meraki Dashboard and select **my profile**

4. Locate the section titled **Dashboard API access** and select **Generate new API key**

*Note: The API key is associated with a Dashboard administrator account. You can generate, revoke, and regenerate your API key on your profile.*

**Keep your API key safe as it provides authentication to all of your organizations with the API enabled. If your API key is shared, you can regenerate your API key at any time. This will revoke the existing API key.**

Copy and store your API key in a safe place. Dashboard does not store API keys in plaintext for security reasons, so this is the only time you will be able to record it. If you lose or forget your API key, you will have to revoke it and generate a new one.

Every request must specify an API key via a request header.

The API key must be specified in the URL header. The API will return a 404 (rather than a 403) in response to a request with a missing or incorrect API key in order to prevent leaking the existence of resources to unauthorized users.

## Versioning
Once an API version is released, we will make only backwards-compatible changes to it. Backwards-compatible changes include:

* Adding new API resources

* Adding new optional request parameters to existing API methods

* Adding new properties to existing API responses

* Changing the order of properties in existing API responses

## Rate Limit
* The Dashboard API is limited to **5 calls per second**, per organization.
* A burst of 5 additional calls are allowed in the first second, so a maximum of 15 calls in the first 2 seconds.
* The rate limiting technique is based off of the [token bucket model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Token_bucket).
* An error with a `429` status code will be returned when the rate limit has been exceeded.
* Expect to backoff for 1 - 2 seconds if the limit has been exceeded. You may have to wait potentially longer if a large number of requests were made within this timeframe.


## Additional Details
Identifiers in the API are opaque strings. A `{networkId}`, for example, might be the string "126043", whereas an `{orderId}` might contain characters, such as "4S1234567". Client applications must not try to parse them as numbers. Even identifiers that look like numbers might be too long to encode without loss of precision in Javascript, where the only numeric type is IEEE 754 floating point.

Verbs in the API follow the usual REST conventions:

`GET` returns the value of a resource or a list of resources, depending on whether an identifier is specified. For example, a `GET` of `/organizations` returns a list of organizations, whereas a `GET` of `/organizations/{organizationId}` returns a particular organization.

`POST` adds a new resource, as in a `POST` to `/organizations/{organizationId}/admins`, or performs some other non-idempotent change.

`PUT` updates a resource. `PUTs` are idempotent; they update a resource, creating it first if it does not already exist. A `PUT` should specify all the fields of a resource; the API will revert omitted fields to their default value.

`DELETE` removes a resource.

1. Begin by logging into [Meraki Dashboard](https://dashboard.meraki.com) and navigating to **Organization > Settings**

2. Locate the section titled **Dashboard API access** and select **Enable Access**, then **Save** your changes

3. After enabling the API, choose your username at the top-right of the Meraki Dashboard and select **my profile**

4. Locate the section titled **Dashboard API access** and select **Generate new API key**

*Note: The API key is associated with a Dashboard administrator account. You can generate, revoke, and regenerate your API key on your profile.*

**Keep your API key safe as it provides authentication to all of your organizations with the API enabled. If your API key is shared, you can regenerate your API key at any time. This will revoke the existing API key.**

Copy and store your API key in a safe place. Dashboard does not store API keys in plaintext for security reasons, so this is the only time you will be able to record it. If you lose or forget your API key, you will have to revoke it and generate a new one.

Every request must specify an API key via a request header.

The API key must be specified in the URL header. The API will return a 404 (rather than a 403) in response to a request with a missing or incorrect API key in order to prevent leaking the existence of resources to unauthorized users.

## Versioning
Once an API version is released, we will make only backwards-compatible changes to it. Backwards-compatible changes include:

* Adding new API resources

* Adding new optional request parameters to existing API methods

* Adding new properties to existing API responses

* Changing the order of properties in existing API responses

## Rate Limit
* The Dashboard API is limited to **5 calls per second**, per organization.
* A burst of 5 additional calls are allowed in the first second, so a maximum of 15 calls in the first 2 seconds.
* The rate limiting technique is based off of the [token bucket model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Token_bucket).
* An error with a `429` status code will be returned when the rate limit has been exceeded.
* Expect to backoff for 1 - 2 seconds if the limit has been exceeded. You may have to wait potentially longer if a large number of requests were made within this timeframe.


## Additional Details
Identifiers in the API are opaque strings. A `{networkId}`, for example, might be the string "126043", whereas an `{orderId}` might contain characters, such as "4S1234567". Client applications must not try to parse them as numbers. Even identifiers that look like numbers might be too long to encode without loss of precision in Javascript, where the only numeric type is IEEE 754 floating point.

Verbs in the API follow the usual REST conventions:

`GET` returns the value of a resource or a list of resources, depending on whether an identifier is specified. For example, a `GET` of `/organizations` returns a list of organizations, whereas a `GET` of `/organizations/{organizationId}` returns a particular organization.

`POST` adds a new resource, as in a `POST` to `/organizations/{organizationId}/admins`, or performs some other non-idempotent change.

`PUT` updates a resource. `PUTs` are idempotent; they update a resource, creating it first if it does not already exist. A `PUT` should specify all the fields of a resource; the API will revert omitted fields to their default value.

`DELETE` removes a resource.

## What can the API be used for?
The Dashboard API can be used for many purposes. It's meant to be an open-ended tool. Here are some examples of use cases:

* Add new organizations, admins, networks, devices, VLANs, and more
* Configure networks at scale
* Automatically on-board and off-board new employees' teleworker setups
* Build your own dashboard for store managers, field techs, or unique use cases

## Rate Limit
* The Dashboard API is limited to **5 calls per second**, per organization.
* A burst of 5 additional calls are allowed in the first second, so a maximum of 15 calls in the first 2 seconds.
* The rate limiting technique is based off of the [token bucket model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Token_bucket).
* An error with a `429` status code will be returned when the rate limit has been exceeded.
* Expect to backoff for 1 - 2 seconds if the limit has been exceeded. You may have to wait potentially longer if a large number of requests were made within this timeframe.


## Additional Details
Identifiers in the API are opaque strings. A `{networkId}`, for example, might be the string "126043", whereas an `{orderId}` might contain characters, such as "4S1234567". Client applications must not try to parse them as numbers. Even identifiers that look like numbers might be too long to encode without loss of precision in Javascript, where the only numeric type is IEEE 754 floating point.

Verbs in the API follow the usual REST conventions:

`GET` returns the value of a resource or a list of resources, depending on whether an identifier is specified. For example, a `GET` of `/organizations` returns a list of organizations, whereas a `GET` of `/organizations/{organizationId}` returns a particular organization.

`POST` adds a new resource, as in a `POST` to `/organizations/{organizationId}/admins`, or performs some other non-idempotent change.

`PUT` updates a resource. `PUTs` are idempotent; they update a resource, creating it first if it does not already exist. A `PUT` should specify all the fields of a resource; the API will revert omitted fields to their default value.

`DELETE` removes a resource.

 * @param {object} parameters - method options and parameters
     * @param {string} parameters.organizationId - The Cisco Meraki Dashboard API is a modern REST API based on the [OpenAPI](https://swagger.io/docs/specification/about/) specification.

## What can the API be used for?
The Dashboard API can be used for many purposes. It's meant to be an open-ended tool. Here are some examples of use cases:

* Add new organizations, admins, networks, devices, VLANs, and more
* Configure networks at scale
* Automatically on-board and off-board new employees' teleworker setups
* Build your own dashboard for store managers, field techs, or unique use cases

## Enabling the Dashboard API
1. Begin by logging into [Meraki Dashboard](https://dashboard.meraki.com) and navigating to **Organization > Settings**

2. Locate the section titled **Dashboard API access** and select **Enable Access**, then **Save** your changes

3. After enabling the API, choose your username at the top-right of the Meraki Dashboard and select **my profile**

4. Locate the section titled **Dashboard API access** and select **Generate new API key**

*Note: The API key is associated with a Dashboard administrator account. You can generate, revoke, and regenerate your API key on your profile.*

**Keep your API key safe as it provides authentication to all of your organizations with the API enabled. If your API key is shared, you can regenerate your API key at any time. This will revoke the existing API key.**

Copy and store your API key in a safe place. Dashboard does not store API keys in plaintext for security reasons, so this is the only time you will be able to record it. If you lose or forget your API key, you will have to revoke it and generate a new one.

Every request must specify an API key via a request header.

The API key must be specified in the URL header. The API will return a 404 (rather than a 403) in response to a request with a missing or incorrect API key in order to prevent leaking the existence of resources to unauthorized users.

## Versioning
Once an API version is released, we will make only backwards-compatible changes to it. Backwards-compatible changes include:

* Adding new API resources

* Adding new optional request parameters to existing API methods

* Adding new properties to existing API responses

* Changing the order of properties in existing API responses

Identifiers in the API are opaque strings. A `{networkId}`, for example, might be the string "126043", whereas an `{orderId}` might contain characters, such as "4S1234567". Client applications must not try to parse them as numbers. Even identifiers that look like numbers might be too long to encode without loss of precision in Javascript, where the only numeric type is IEEE 754 floating point.

Verbs in the API follow the usual REST conventions:

`GET` returns the value of a resource or a list of resources, depending on whether an identifier is specified. For example, a `GET` of `/organizations` returns a list of organizations, whereas a `GET` of `/organizations/{organizationId}` returns a particular organization.

`POST` adds a new resource, as in a `POST` to `/organizations/{organizationId}/admins`, or performs some other non-idempotent change.

`PUT` updates a resource. `PUTs` are idempotent; they update a resource, creating it first if it does not already exist. A `PUT` should specify all the fields of a resource; the API will revert omitted fields to their default value.

`DELETE` removes a resource.

     * @param {integer} parameters.perPage - The number of entries per page returned. Acceptable range is 3 - 1000. Default is 1000.
     * @param {string} parameters.startingAfter - A token used by the server to indicate the start of the page. Often this is a timestamp or an ID but it is not limited to those. This parameter should not be defined by client applications. The link for the first, last, prev, or next page in the HTTP Link header should define it.
     * @param {string} parameters.endingBefore - A token used by the server to indicate the end of the page. Often this is a timestamp or an ID but it is not limited to those. This parameter should not be defined by client applications. The link for the first, last, prev, or next page in the HTTP Link header should define it.

/**
 * Return the inventory for an organization
 * @method
 * @name MerakiDashboardApi#getOrganizationInventory
 * @param {object} parameters - method options and parameters
     * @param {string} parameters.organizationId - The Cisco Meraki Dashboard API is a modern REST API based on the [OpenAPI](https://swagger.io/docs/specification/about/) specification.

## What can the API be used for?
The Dashboard API can be used for many purposes. It's meant to be an open-ended tool. Here are some examples of use cases:

* Add new organizations, admins, networks, devices, VLANs, and more
* Configure networks at scale
* Automatically on-board and off-board new employees' teleworker setups
* Build your own dashboard for store managers, field techs, or unique use cases

## Enabling the Dashboard API
1. Begin by logging into [Meraki Dashboard](https://dashboard.meraki.com) and navigating to **Organization > Settings**

2. Locate the section titled **Dashboard API access** and select **Enable Access**, then **Save** your changes

3. After enabling the API, choose your username at the top-right of the Meraki Dashboard and select **my profile**

4. Locate the section titled **Dashboard API access** and select **Generate new API key**

*Note: The API key is associated with a Dashboard administrator account. You can generate, revoke, and regenerate your API key on your profile.*

**Keep your API key safe as it provides authentication to all of your organizations with the API enabled. If your API key is shared, you can regenerate your API key at any time. This will revoke the existing API key.**

Copy and store your API key in a safe place. Dashboard does not store API keys in plaintext for security reasons, so this is the only time you will be able to record it. If you lose or forget your API key, you will have to revoke it and generate a new one.

Every request must specify an API key via a request header.

The API key must be specified in the URL header. The API will return a 404 (rather than a 403) in response to a request with a missing or incorrect API key in order to prevent leaking the existence of resources to unauthorized users.

## Versioning
Once an API version is released, we will make only backwards-compatible changes to it. Backwards-compatible changes include:

* Adding new API resources

* Adding new optional request parameters to existing API methods

* Adding new properties to existing API responses

* Changing the order of properties in existing API responses

## Rate Limit
* The Dashboard API is limited to **5 calls per second**, per organization.
* A burst of 5 additional calls are allowed in the first second, so a maximum of 15 calls in the first 2 seconds.
* The rate limiting technique is based off of the [token bucket model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Token_bucket).
* An error with a `429` status code will be returned when the rate limit has been exceeded.
* Expect to backoff for 1 - 2 seconds if the limit has been exceeded. You may have to wait potentially longer if a large number of requests were made within this timeframe.

 * Combine multiple networks into a single network
 * @method
 * @name MerakiDashboardApi#combineOrganizationNetworks
 * @param {object} parameters - method options and parameters
     * @param {string} parameters.organizationId - The Cisco Meraki Dashboard API is a modern REST API based on the [OpenAPI](https://swagger.io/docs/specification/about/) specification.

## What can the API be used for?
The Dashboard API can be used for many purposes. It's meant to be an open-ended tool. Here are some examples of use cases:

* Add new organizations, admins, networks, devices, VLANs, and more
* Configure networks at scale
* Automatically on-board and off-board new employees' teleworker setups
* Build your own dashboard for store managers, field techs, or unique use cases

## Enabling the Dashboard API
1. Begin by logging into [Meraki Dashboard](https://dashboard.meraki.com) and navigating to **Organization > Settings**

2. Locate the section titled **Dashboard API access** and select **Enable Access**, then **Save** your changes

3. After enabling the API, choose your username at the top-right of the Meraki Dashboard and select **my profile**

4. Locate the section titled **Dashboard API access** and select **Generate new API key**

*Note: The API key is associated with a Dashboard administrator account. You can generate, revoke, and regenerate your API key on your profile.*

**Keep your API key safe as it provides authentication to all of your organizations with the API enabled. If your API key is shared, you can regenerate your API key at any time. This will revoke the existing API key.**

Copy and store your API key in a safe place. Dashboard does not store API keys in plaintext for security reasons, so this is the only time you will be able to record it. If you lose or forget your API key, you will have to revoke it and generate a new one.

Every request must specify an API key via a request header.

The API key must be specified in the URL header. The API will return a 404 (rather than a 403) in response to a request with a missing or incorrect API key in order to prevent leaking the existence of resources to unauthorized users.

## Versioning
Once an API version is released, we will make only backwards-compatible changes to it. Backwards-compatible changes include:

* Adding new API resources

* Adding new optional request parameters to existing API methods

* Adding new properties to existing API responses

* Changing the order of properties in existing API responses

## Rate Limit
* The Dashboard API is limited to **5 calls per second**, per organization.
* A burst of 5 additional calls are allowed in the first second, so a maximum of 15 calls in the first 2 seconds.
* The rate limiting technique is based off of the [token bucket model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Token_bucket).
* An error with a `429` status code will be returned when the rate limit has been exceeded.
* Expect to backoff for 1 - 2 seconds if the limit has been exceeded. You may have to wait potentially longer if a large number of requests were made within this timeframe.


## Additional Details
Identifiers in the API are opaque strings. A `{networkId}`, for example, might be the string "126043", whereas an `{orderId}` might contain characters, such as "4S1234567". Client applications must not try to parse them as numbers. Even identifiers that look like numbers might be too long to encode without loss of precision in Javascript, where the only numeric type is IEEE 754 floating point.

Verbs in the API follow the usual REST conventions:

`GET` returns the value of a resource or a list of resources, depending on whether an identifier is specified. For example, a `GET` of `/organizations` returns a list of organizations, whereas a `GET` of `/organizations/{organizationId}` returns a particular organization.

`POST` adds a new resource, as in a `POST` to `/organizations/{organizationId}/admins`, or performs some other non-idempotent change.

`PUT` updates a resource. `PUTs` are idempotent; they update a resource, creating it first if it does not already exist. A `PUT` should specify all the fields of a resource; the API will revert omitted fields to their default value.

`DELETE` removes a resource.

## Enabling the Dashboard API
1. Begin by logging into [Meraki Dashboard](https://dashboard.meraki.com) and navigating to **Organization > Settings**

2. Locate the section titled **Dashboard API access** and select **Enable Access**, then **Save** your changes

3. After enabling the API, choose your username at the top-right of the Meraki Dashboard and select **my profile**

4. Locate the section titled **Dashboard API access** and select **Generate new API key**

*Note: The API key is associated with a Dashboard administrator account. You can generate, revoke, and regenerate your API key on your profile.*

**Keep your API key safe as it provides authentication to all of your organizations with the API enabled. If your API key is shared, you can regenerate your API key at any time. This will revoke the existing API key.**

Copy and store your API key in a safe place. Dashboard does not store API keys in plaintext for security reasons, so this is the only time you will be able to record it. If you lose or forget your API key, you will have to revoke it and generate a new one.

Every request must specify an API key via a request header.

The API key must be specified in the URL header. The API will return a 404 (rather than a 403) in response to a request with a missing or incorrect API key in order to prevent leaking the existence of resources to unauthorized users.

## Versioning
Once an API version is released, we will make only backwards-compatible changes to it. Backwards-compatible changes include:

* Adding new API resources

* Adding new optional request parameters to existing API methods

* Adding new properties to existing API responses

* Changing the order of properties in existing API responses

## Rate Limit
* The Dashboard API is limited to **5 calls per second**, per organization.
* A burst of 5 additional calls are allowed in the first second, so a maximum of 15 calls in the first 2 seconds.
* The rate limiting technique is based off of the [token bucket model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Token_bucket).
* An error with a `429` status code will be returned when the rate limit has been exceeded.
* Expect to backoff for 1 - 2 seconds if the limit has been exceeded. You may have to wait potentially longer if a large number of requests were made within this timeframe.


## Additional Details
Identifiers in the API are opaque strings. A `{networkId}`, for example, might be the string "126043", whereas an `{orderId}` might contain characters, such as "4S1234567". Client applications must not try to parse them as numbers. Even identifiers that look like numbers might be too long to encode without loss of precision in Javascript, where the only numeric type is IEEE 754 floating point.

Verbs in the API follow the usual REST conventions:

`GET` returns the value of a resource or a list of resources, depending on whether an identifier is specified. For example, a `GET` of `/organizations` returns a list of organizations, whereas a `GET` of `/organizations/{organizationId}` returns a particular organization.

`POST` adds a new resource, as in a `POST` to `/organizations/{organizationId}/admins`, or performs some other non-idempotent change.

`PUT` updates a resource. `PUTs` are idempotent; they update a resource, creating it first if it does not already exist. A `PUT` should specify all the fields of a resource; the API will revert omitted fields to their default value.

`DELETE` removes a resource.

     * @param {string} parameters.id - The Cisco Meraki Dashboard API is a modern REST API based on the [OpenAPI](https://swagger.io/docs/specification/about/) specification.

## What can the API be used for?
The Dashboard API can be used for many purposes. It's meant to be an open-ended tool. Here are some examples of use cases:

* Add new organizations, admins, networks, devices, VLANs, and more
* Configure networks at scale
* Automatically on-board and off-board new employees' teleworker setups
* Build your own dashboard for store managers, field techs, or unique use cases

/**
 * Returns all supported intrusion settings for an organization
 * @method
 * @name MerakiDashboardApi#getOrganizationSecurityIntrusionSettings
 * @param {object} parameters - method options and parameters
     * @param {string} parameters.organizationId - The Cisco Meraki Dashboard API is a modern REST API based on the [OpenAPI](https://swagger.io/docs/specification/about/) specification.

## What can the API be used for?
The Dashboard API can be used for many purposes. It's meant to be an open-ended tool. Here are some examples of use cases:

* Add new organizations, admins, networks, devices, VLANs, and more
* Configure networks at scale
* Automatically on-board and off-board new employees' teleworker setups
* Build your own dashboard for store managers, field techs, or unique use cases

## Enabling the Dashboard API
1. Begin by logging into [Meraki Dashboard](https://dashboard.meraki.com) and navigating to **Organization > Settings**

2. Locate the section titled **Dashboard API access** and select **Enable Access**, then **Save** your changes

3. After enabling the API, choose your username at the top-right of the Meraki Dashboard and select **my profile**

4. Locate the section titled **Dashboard API access** and select **Generate new API key**

*Note: The API key is associated with a Dashboard administrator account. You can generate, revoke, and regenerate your API key on your profile.*

**Keep your API key safe as it provides authentication to all of your organizations with the API enabled. If your API key is shared, you can regenerate your API key at any time. This will revoke the existing API key.**

Copy and store your API key in a safe place. Dashboard does not store API keys in plaintext for security reasons, so this is the only time you will be able to record it. If you lose or forget your API key, you will have to revoke it and generate a new one.

Every request must specify an API key via a request header.

The API key must be specified in the URL header. The API will return a 404 (rather than a 403) in response to a request with a missing or incorrect API key in order to prevent leaking the existence of resources to unauthorized users.

## Versioning
Once an API version is released, we will make only backwards-compatible changes to it. Backwards-compatible changes include:

* Adding new API resources

* Adding new optional request parameters to existing API methods

* Adding new properties to existing API responses

* Changing the order of properties in existing API responses

## Rate Limit
* The Dashboard API is limited to **5 calls per second**, per organization.
* A burst of 5 additional calls are allowed in the first second, so a maximum of 15 calls in the first 2 seconds.
* The rate limiting technique is based off of the [token bucket model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Token_bucket).
* An error with a `429` status code will be returned when the rate limit has been exceeded.
* Expect to backoff for 1 - 2 seconds if the limit has been exceeded. You may have to wait potentially longer if a large number of requests were made within this timeframe.


## Additional Details
Identifiers in the API are opaque strings. A `{networkId}`, for example, might be the string "126043", whereas an `{orderId}` might contain characters, such as "4S1234567". Client applications must not try to parse them as numbers. Even identifiers that look like numbers might be too long to encode without loss of precision in Javascript, where the only numeric type is IEEE 754 floating point.

Verbs in the API follow the usual REST conventions:

`GET` returns the value of a resource or a list of resources, depending on whether an identifier is specified. For example, a `GET` of `/organizations` returns a list of organizations, whereas a `GET` of `/organizations/{organizationId}` returns a particular organization.

`POST` adds a new resource, as in a `POST` to `/organizations/{organizationId}/admins`, or performs some other non-idempotent change.

`PUT` updates a resource. `PUTs` are idempotent; they update a resource, creating it first if it does not already exist. A `PUT` should specify all the fields of a resource; the API will revert omitted fields to their default value.

`DELETE` removes a resource.

/**
 * Update the SNMP settings for an organization
 * @method
 * @name MerakiDashboardApi#updateOrganizationSnmp
 * @param {object} parameters - method options and parameters
     * @param {string} parameters.organizationId - The Cisco Meraki Dashboard API is a modern REST API based on the [OpenAPI](https://swagger.io/docs/specification/about/) specification.

## What can the API be used for?
The Dashboard API can be used for many purposes. It's meant to be an open-ended tool. Here are some examples of use cases:

* Add new organizations, admins, networks, devices, VLANs, and more
* Configure networks at scale
* Automatically on-board and off-board new employees' teleworker setups
* Build your own dashboard for store managers, field techs, or unique use cases

## Enabling the Dashboard API
1. Begin by logging into [Meraki Dashboard](https://dashboard.meraki.com) and navigating to **Organization > Settings**

2. Locate the section titled **Dashboard API access** and select **Enable Access**, then **Save** your changes

3. After enabling the API, choose your username at the top-right of the Meraki Dashboard and select **my profile**

4. Locate the section titled **Dashboard API access** and select **Generate new API key**

*Note: The API key is associated with a Dashboard administrator account. You can generate, revoke, and regenerate your API key on your profile.*

**Keep your API key safe as it provides authentication to all of your organizations with the API enabled. If your API key is shared, you can regenerate your API key at any time. This will revoke the existing API key.**

Copy and store your API key in a safe place. Dashboard does not store API keys in plaintext for security reasons, so this is the only time you will be able to record it. If you lose or forget your API key, you will have to revoke it and generate a new one.

Every request must specify an API key via a request header.

The API key must be specified in the URL header. The API will return a 404 (rather than a 403) in response to a request with a missing or incorrect API key in order to prevent leaking the existence of resources to unauthorized users.

## Versioning
Once an API version is released, we will make only backwards-compatible changes to it. Backwards-compatible changes include:

* Adding new API resources

* Adding new optional request parameters to existing API methods

* Adding new properties to existing API responses

* Changing the order of properties in existing API responses

## Rate Limit
* The Dashboard API is limited to **5 calls per second**, per organization.
* A burst of 5 additional calls are allowed in the first second, so a maximum of 15 calls in the first 2 seconds.
* The rate limiting technique is based off of the [token bucket model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Token_bucket).
* An error with a `429` status code will be returned when the rate limit has been exceeded.
* Expect to backoff for 1 - 2 seconds if the limit has been exceeded. You may have to wait potentially longer if a large number of requests were made within this timeframe.


## Additional Details
Identifiers in the API are opaque strings. A `{networkId}`, for example, might be the string "126043", whereas an `{orderId}` might contain characters, such as "4S1234567". Client applications must not try to parse them as numbers. Even identifiers that look like numbers might be too long to encode without loss of precision in Javascript, where the only numeric type is IEEE 754 floating point.

Verbs in the API follow the usual REST conventions:

`GET` returns the value of a resource or a list of resources, depending on whether an identifier is specified. For example, a `GET` of `/organizations` returns a list of organizations, whereas a `GET` of `/organizations/{organizationId}` returns a particular organization.

`POST` adds a new resource, as in a `POST` to `/organizations/{organizationId}/admins`, or performs some other non-idempotent change.

`PUT` updates a resource. `PUTs` are idempotent; they update a resource, creating it first if it does not already exist. A `PUT` should specify all the fields of a resource; the API will revert omitted fields to their default value.

`DELETE` removes a resource.

/**
 * Return the firewall rules for an organization's site-to-site VPN
 * @method
 * @name MerakiDashboardApi#getOrganizationVpnFirewallRules
 * @param {object} parameters - method options and parameters
     * @param {string} parameters.organizationId - The Cisco Meraki Dashboard API is a modern REST API based on the [OpenAPI](https://swagger.io/docs/specification/about/) specification.

## What can the API be used for?
The Dashboard API can be used for many purposes. It's meant to be an open-ended tool. Here are some examples of use cases:

* Add new organizations, admins, networks, devices, VLANs, and more
* Configure networks at scale
* Automatically on-board and off-board new employees' teleworker setups
* Build your own dashboard for store managers, field techs, or unique use cases

## Enabling the Dashboard API
1. Begin by logging into [Meraki Dashboard](https://dashboard.meraki.com) and navigating to **Organization > Settings**

2. Locate the section titled **Dashboard API access** and select **Enable Access**, then **Save** your changes

3. After enabling the API, choose your username at the top-right of the Meraki Dashboard and select **my profile**

4. Locate the section titled **Dashboard API access** and select **Generate new API key**

*Note: The API key is associated with a Dashboard administrator account. You can generate, revoke, and regenerate your API key on your profile.*

**Keep your API key safe as it provides authentication to all of your organizations with the API enabled. If your API key is shared, you can regenerate your API key at any time. This will revoke the existing API key.**

Copy and store your API key in a safe place. Dashboard does not store API keys in plaintext for security reasons, so this is the only time you will be able to record it. If you lose or forget your API key, you will have to revoke it and generate a new one.

Every request must specify an API key via a request header.

The API key must be specified in the URL header. The API will return a 404 (rather than a 403) in response to a request with a missing or incorrect API key in order to prevent leaking the existence of resources to unauthorized users.

## Versioning
Once an API version is released, we will make only backwards-compatible changes to it. Backwards-compatible changes include:

* Adding new API resources

* Adding new optional request parameters to existing API methods

* Adding new properties to existing API responses

* Changing the order of properties in existing API responses

## Rate Limit
* The Dashboard API is limited to **5 calls per second**, per organization.
* A burst of 5 additional calls are allowed in the first second, so a maximum of 15 calls in the first 2 seconds.
* The rate limiting technique is based off of the [token bucket model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Token_bucket).
* An error with a `429` status code will be returned when the rate limit has been exceeded.
* Expect to backoff for 1 - 2 seconds if the limit has been exceeded. You may have to wait potentially longer if a large number of requests were made within this timeframe.


## Additional Details
Identifiers in the API are opaque strings. A `{networkId}`, for example, might be the string "126043", whereas an `{orderId}` might contain characters, such as "4S1234567". Client applications must not try to parse them as numbers. Even identifiers that look like numbers might be too long to encode without loss of precision in Javascript, where the only numeric type is IEEE 754 floating point.

Verbs in the API follow the usual REST conventions:

`GET` returns the value of a resource or a list of resources, depending on whether an identifier is specified. For example, a `GET` of `/organizations` returns a list of organizations, whereas a `GET` of `/organizations/{organizationId}` returns a particular organization.

`POST` adds a new resource, as in a `POST` to `/organizations/{organizationId}/admins`, or performs some other non-idempotent change.

`PUT` updates a resource. `PUTs` are idempotent; they update a resource, creating it first if it does not already exist. A `PUT` should specify all the fields of a resource; the API will revert omitted fields to their default value.

`DELETE` removes a resource.
